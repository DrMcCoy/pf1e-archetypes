					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

Once a trap is learned, it can&#146;t be unlearned and replaced with a different type of trap. The trapper cannot select an individual trap more than once. This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s spells class feature.

If fired at a square, the trap is treated as if the ranger had set the trap in that square, except the DC is 5 lower than normal. If fired at a creature, the target takes damage from the ranged weapon and is treated as if it had triggered the trap (saving throw applies, if any). The attack has a maximum range of 60 feet, and range increments apply to the attack roll. The duration of the trapped projectile starts from when it is created, not from when it is used.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A trapper is a ranger who focuses exclusively on traps, rather than learning conventional magic. A trapper has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disable Device (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A trapper adds 1/2 her ranger level on Perception skill checks made to locate traps and on Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1). A trapper can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Trap: </b>At 5th level, a trapper learns how to create a snare trap and one other ranger trap of her choice. At 7th level and every two levels thereafter, she learns another trap. The trapper can use these traps a total number of times per day equal to 1/2 her ranger level + her Wisdom modifier. Once a trap is learned, it can&#146;t be unlearned and replaced with a different type of trap. The trapper cannot select an individual trap more than once. This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s spells class feature. Trappers do not gain any spells or spellcasting ability, do not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger and spell completion magic items.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Launch Trap: </b>At 10th level, a trapper can affix a magical ranger trap to an arrow, crossbow bolt, or thrown weapon, allowing her to set the trap remotely or use it as a direct attack. Attaching the trap to the projectile is part of the full-round action of creating a new trap. The trapped projectile is fired or thrown in the normal manner. If fired at a square, the trap is treated as if the ranger had set the trap in that square, except the DC is 5 lower than normal. If fired at a creature, the target takes damage from the ranged weapon and is treated as if it had triggered the trap (saving throw applies, if any). The attack has a maximum range of 60 feet, and range increments apply to the attack roll. The duration of the trapped projectile starts from when it is created, not from when it is used.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

Additionally, its floor is either elevated or constructed of a different substance than the nearby ground, preventing creatures outside of the shelter from using tremorsense to detect creatures inside, and vice versa. Finally, the clever structure of the hideaway causes creatures outside of the shelter to take a &#150;10 penalty on Perception checks to notice creatures inside, as if through a 1-foot-thick wall, while only causing creatures inside to take a &#150;2 penalty on Perception checks to notice creatures outside.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Transporters specialize in smuggling people as efficiently as possible through harsh and difficult environments. Individuals such as escaped political exiles, refugees fleeing danger, and various criminals all seek the transporter&#146;s services. While some transporters actively work to serve justice or a political cause, others are wily opportunists filling a need and profiting from the high price that desperate people are willing to pay for safe, discrete passage.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Trailbreaker (Ex): </b>A transporter constantly works to obscure his trail. He increases the Survival DC to track him, or a group of which he is a part, by an amount equal to half his ranger level (minimum 1). This does not stack with similar abilities, such as a traceless operative&#146;s trackless ability.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Plot Course: </b>At 3rd level, a transporter can spend 1d4 hours and attempt a DC 15 Knowledge (geography) check to plot a subtle course of travel between his current location and another destination. The transporter&#146;s course of travel is almost never direct, as it is optimized for smuggling. Thereafter, the transporter gains a +2 bonus on initiative, Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks involving traveling along his plotted course.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, if the transporter&#146;s Knowledge (geography) check exceeds the DC by 10, the bonuses increase to +4. At 13th level, if his Knowledge (geography) check exceeds the DC by 20, the bonuses increase to +6, and at 18th level, if the transporter&#146;s check exceeds the DC by 30, the bonuses increase to +8.</p>
			<p>A transporter can gain the benefits of only a single plotted course at any given time. If the transporter ever strays from the course or attempts to plot a new course for any reason, he loses the benefits of his current course immediately. A transporter can retry his Knowledge (geography) check to plot a course as long as he spends 1d4 hours each time.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Smuggler&#146;s Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a transporter must choose his allies as his hunter&#146;s bond, not an animal companion. Instead of granting the transporter&#146;s favored enemy bonus to his allies as a move action, he instead grants his plot course bonus to his allies constantly.</p>
			<p>This ability alters hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Hideaway (Ex): </b>A transporter can spend 1 hour and attempt a DC 20 Survival check to create a hidden shelter, useful for staying unseen by patrols of enemy creatures. The transporter&#146;s shelter can hold the transporter and one additional creature for every 2 by which the transporter exceeds the DC. The created shelter incorporates scents from the local area, preventing creatures on the inside from being detected by the scent ability of creatures outside of the shelter, and vice versa. Additionally, its floor is either elevated or constructed of a different substance than the nearby ground, preventing creatures outside of the shelter from using tremorsense to detect creatures inside, and vice versa. Finally, the clever structure of the hideaway causes creatures outside of the shelter to take a &#150;10 penalty on Perception checks to notice creatures inside, as if through a 1-foot-thick wall, while only causing creatures inside to take a &#150;2 penalty on Perception checks to notice creatures outside.</p>
			<p>These bonuses do not apply if the enemy creatures are intimately familiar with the area in which the hideaway was built (such as an area right near their home).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills).

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A yokai hunter possesses a supernatural ability to sense beings connected to the spirit world, such as kami, oni, and ghosts, and is formidable at fighting them. At 1st level, a yokai hunter gains a +2 bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against one of the following creature types (and subtypes, if applicable), which are considered yokai for the purposes of this archetype: aberration, dragon, fey, magical beast, outsider (native), and undead (incorporeal). (A GM may choose to alter this list for the purposes of her campaign.) At 5th level and every five levels thereafter, a yokai hunter may select another favored yokai from this list, gaining a +2 bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against that yokai.</p>
					<p>In addition, whenever a yokai hunter sees a favored yokai that is disguised or has not made its otherworldly essence known, he gains an automatic check to identify the creature as such. To make this check, a yokai hunter rolls 1d20 and adds his yokai hunter level and Charisma modifier (DC 10 + 1/2 the yokai&#146;s Hit Dice + the yokai&#146;s Cha modifier). A successful check means that the yokai hunter recognizes the creature&#146;s ties to the spiritual world.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Yokai hunters possess a supernatural tether to the spirit worlds that shroud mortal existence. They use their powers to peer into the realm of the dead, and are adept at hunting those who dwell in the realm between the Material Plane and the Great Beyond, the supernatural beings Tians refer to as yokai. The yokai hunter is an archetype of the ranger class.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Yokai (Su): </b>A yokai hunter possesses a supernatural ability to sense beings connected to the spirit world, such as kami, oni, and ghosts, and is formidable at fighting them. At 1st level, a yokai hunter gains a +2 bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against one of the following creature types (and subtypes, if applicable), which are considered yokai for the purposes of this archetype: aberration, dragon, fey, magical beast, outsider (native), and undead (incorporeal). (A GM may choose to alter this list for the purposes of her campaign.) At 5th level and every five levels thereafter, a yokai hunter may select another favored yokai from this list, gaining a +2 bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against that yokai.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever a yokai hunter sees a favored yokai that is disguised or has not made its otherworldly essence known, he gains an automatic check to identify the creature as such. To make this check, a yokai hunter rolls 1d20 and adds his yokai hunter level and Charisma modifier (DC 10 + 1/2 the yokai&#146;s Hit Dice + the yokai&#146;s Cha modifier). A successful check means that the yokai hunter recognizes the creature&#146;s ties to the spiritual world. Regardless of whether the check is successful, a yokai hunter gains the bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against favored yokai.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces favored enemy. Ranger abilities that rely on a favored enemy instead rely on this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Yokai Sense (Su): </b>At 7th level, a yokai hunter can sense yokai he has identified with his favored yokai ability as though he had blindsense out to a range of 60 feet. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Yokai (Su): </b>At 12th level, a yokai hunter can attempt to shrug off the magical energies of a yokai. He gains a +4 insight bonus on saving throws to resist the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of favored yokai. In addition, once per day as a standard action, a yokai hunter can shed an effect placed on him by a yokai as break enchantment, using his yokai hunter level as his caster level. This ability replaces camouflage.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Witchguards are the sworn defenders of the White Witches of Irrisen. Although the White Witches are spellcasters of immense power, even they cannot defend themselves against every attack. Witchguards dedicate their lives to protecting their charges, and they gain some arcane knowledge in return. They are trained to work closely with witches and defend their charges from harm. Witchguards learn magical abilities from the same patrons that grant witches their powers, though they can use their abilities to protect any kind of spellcaster, not just a witch. A witchguard is ready to face any foe that might threaten his charge, and he is ever prepared to lay down his life to protect the life of the person he is sworn to defend.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Bodyguard (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a witchguard gains BodyguardAPG as a bonus feat, even if he doesn&#146;t meet the prerequisite. This ability replaces endurance.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Defend Charge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a witchguard forms a bond with a spellcaster he has sworn to defend. Once per day, this bond allows the witchguard to spend a move action to grant an adjacent spellcaster a +2 dodge bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration checks. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 2. The bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to the witchguard&#146;s Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the witchguard can use this ability one additional time per day. This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Patron (Su): </b>A witchguard learns something of arcane magic from the witches he defends. At 4th level, when a witchguard gains the ability to cast spells, he must also select a patron, as the witch class feature (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 70). This patron is usually the same as the patron of the witch he is sworn to protect, but the witchguard may choose any patron. The witchguard adds the first four spells from his patron&#146;s spell list to his ranger spell list. The witchguard cannot cast patron spells of a level he is unable to cast.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Sworn Defender (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a witchguard gains In Harm&#146;s WayAPG as a bonus feat. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Wilderness medics know a variety of ways they can supply and preserve a rebellion or similar movement without requiring any resources that might make them easier to track down.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Herbalist Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a wilderness medic can attempt Profession (herbalism) checks untrained and the wilderness medic gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his ranger level (minimum +1) on Heal checks and Profession (herbalism) checks. When he successfully forages for herbs (Pathfinder Player Companion: Heroes of the Wild 10), he finds twice as many doses of any herb he would normally.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Herbal Medicine (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a wilderness medic can mimic the effects of stabilize at will in any wilderness area by spending one use of a healer&#146;s kit as long as he can see the target.</p>
			<p>Additionally, as a standard action a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier, the wilderness medic can use encouraging words and herbs to lessen the severity of certain conditions affecting a touched target. If the target is exhausted, it becomes fatigued instead. If the target is frightened, it becomes shaken instead. If the target is nauseated, it becomes sickened instead. The duration of the effect is unchanged; the effect is simply reduced to the lesser version.</p>
			<p>At 9th level, the wilderness medic can lessen the severity of additional conditions for the target and cure other conditions that the target suffers. If the target creature is blinded, it becomes dazzled instead. If the target is panicked, it becomes shaken instead. If it has any of the following conditions, they are cured: deafened, fatigued, shaken, and sickened. The wilderness medic is able to use this ability on a given touched target once every 24 hours.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the endurance and evasion abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Sp): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Rallying Bond (Sp): </b>At 4th level, a wilderness medic must choose his companions for his hunter&#146;s bond. At 9th level, the wilderness medic can encourage all of his companions when he uses his hunter&#146;s bond to benefit his companions (see the ranger&#146;s hunter&#146;s bond ability on page 66 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for more details). As a free action when the wilderness medic uses a move action to grant affected allies half his favored enemy bonus, he can also grant affected allies the benefits of remove fear. The wilderness medic can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>At 14th level, when the wilderness medic uses this ability, he can instead affect all allies that benefit from his hunter&#146;s bond with blessing of fervorAPG, using his ranger level as his caster level.</p>
			<p>This ability alters hunter&#146;s bond and replaces improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>Additionally, a wilderness explorer can peacefully influence the initial attitude of humanoids that have Intelligence scores of 2 or lower. This ability functions just like wild empathy, but it works on humanoids instead of on animals.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Wilderness explorers are adept at making peaceful contact with remote societies.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Cultural Contact (Ex): </b>A wilderness explorer gains the ability to communicate with creatures with which he doesn&#146;t share a common language. Only basic concepts can be conveyed or understood, such as &#147;I need help,&#148; &#147;I come in peace,&#148; &#147;Come over here,&#148; &#147;Go over there,&#148; and the like. This allows the wilderness explorer to ignore the common language requirement of social interaction and language-dependent spells and effects, but he can do so only when the information being shared is relatively simple. The creature with which the wilderness explorer communicates must understand at least one language for this ability to function.</p>
			<p>Additionally, a wilderness explorer can peacefully influence the initial attitude of humanoids that have Intelligence scores of 2 or lower. This ability functions just like wild empathy, but it works on humanoids instead of on animals. The wilderness explorer can also use this ability to influence a monstrous humanoid with 2 or lower Intelligence, but the wilderness explorer takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p>This replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hazard Sense (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a wilderness explorer gains an intuitive understanding of natural hazards and traps fashioned from a natural environment. He gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves against natural hazards and wilderness traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks from wilderness traps. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>This replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Indigenous Spirit (Su): </b>At 8th level, a wilderness explorer attracts the aid of native spirits, which reward his appreciation of their home with whispered warnings. The wilderness explorer gains uncanny dodge as long as he remains within one of his chosen favored terrains. This works like the barbarian ability of the same name.</p>
			<p>This replaces swift tracker and alters favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Guardian Spirit (Su): </b>At 11th level, a wilderness explorer gains the aid of indigenous spirits, which favor him when he is defending himself against multiple foes that surround him. He gains improved uncanny dodge; this ability functions only while the ranger is within one of his favored terrains.</p>
			<p>This replaces quarry and alters favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Manifest Spirit (Su): </b>At 19th level, a wilderness explorer is shielded from magic by those guardian spirits that favor him. He gains spell resistance equal to 11 + his ranger level. This ability functions only while the wilderness explorer is within one of his favored terrains.</p>
			<p>This replaces improved quarry and alters favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

				<name type="string">Wild Empathy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Civilization grows stronger and more decadent with each passing year. It tears into unclaimed wilderness and destroys the fragile ecology in its constant push for expansion and exploitation. The wild stalker forsakes the bonds of community and lives in the trackless wilds far from others of his kind, or perhaps grew up there, never knowing of civilization as anything more than his enemy. He drives pioneers back to civilization and strives to keep the land unspoiled.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Strong Senses (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a wild stalker&#146;s life among the wild has sharpened his senses. He gains low-light vision and a +1 bonus on Perception checks. If he already has low-light vision, he gains a +2 bonus on Perception checks instead. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 1st (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level, or +7 if the character did not gain low-light vision from this ability). This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s first favored enemy ability.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a wild stalker gains uncanny dodge as the barbarian&#146;s class feature. This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s 2nd-level combat style feat.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Rage of the Wild (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a wild stalker gains the rage ability as the barbarian class feature, but its barbarian level is considered to be his ranger level &#150;3. This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers: </b>At 5th level, a wild stalker ranger gains a single rage power, as the barbarian class feature. He gains another rage power each five levels after 5th (to a maximum of four rage powers at 20th level). This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s second, third, fourth, and fifth favored enemy abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Talents (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a wild stalker can either take a rage power, or gains a +2 insight bonus into any one of the following skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Perception, Stealth, Survival, or Swim. The wild stalker can gain one of these two benefits again every five levels after 6th (to a maximum of 4 times at 20th level). This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s 6th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 18th-level combat style feat abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Hailing from primitive roots in the wild, some rangers venture to more civilized lands and learn their ways. Wild souls carry these more refined teachings back to the frontier lands of their birth, and they employ that knowledge in defense of their homes.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Nemesis (Ex): </b>A wild soul gains a +2 bonus on Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Survival checks against creatures that wield advanced technology, alchemical weapons (including an alchemist&#146;s bombs), or firearms and against those that cast arcane spells (this does not apply to creatures that use spell-like abilities). Likewise, he gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against such opponents. The wild soul can attempt Craft (alchemy), Knowledge (arcana), and Spellcraft checks untrained when attempting to identify enemy magic or advanced technology.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p>This replaces favored enemy.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Unfettered Soul: </b>A wild soul swears to himself never to make use of advanced technology, alchemy, arcane magic, or firearms. He also must oppose their use on his person, refusing to be a willing target and attempting a saving throw if possible (even if the effect is harmless or beneficial). Violating this oath causes a wild soul to lose the abilities granted by this archetype until he atones.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Nemesis Defense (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a wild soul adds his nemesis bonus on saving throws against advanced technology, alchemical items (including an alchemist&#146;s bombs and extracts), and arcane spells. He also adds this bonus to his AC against advanced technological items, alchemical items (including alchemist bombs), arcane spells that require attack rolls, and firearms.</p>
			<p>This replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Break the Interloper (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a wild soul hits an arcane spellcaster, a creature with extract slots, or a creature with grit (but not grit-like pools such as panache) with a weapon attack, the target either loses its highest-level available spell or extract slot or loses 1 point of grit, and the wild soul gains 5 temporary hit points. A target of this ability can negate this effect with a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the ranger&#146;s level + his Wisdom modifier). Regardless of the outcome of the saving throw, the target is immune to this ability for 24 hours.</p>
			<p>This replaces quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Dizzying Onslaught (Ex): </b>At 19th level, a wild soul lands punishing blows that devastate his nemeses&#146; ability to focus. When he confirms a critical hit against a creature against whom his nemesis bonus applies, for 1 minute the target must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the wild soul&#146;s Wisdom modifier + twice the spell&#146;s level) to cast an arcane spell, create an extract, or use an alchemist&#146;s bomb, and the target can&#146;t spend or gain grit.</p>
			<p>This replaces improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Nemesis Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a wild soul becomes death incarnate to his nemeses. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a nemesis at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the wild soul&#146;s level + his Wisdom modifier) or die. The wild soul can instead deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature&#146;s current hit points, which the target can negate with a successful save at the same DC. The ranger can use this ability up to five times per day, but he cannot use it against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>
			<p>This replaces master hunter.</p>

					<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
					<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills).

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger.

Such attacks can make foes fumble or cause them to become entangled within areas of the wild shadow&#146;s favored terrain. As a standard action, the wild shadow denotes one target within line of sight and within one of his favored terrains as his harried prey. Once the foe is so designated, every time the wild shadow hits this harried prey with a melee or ranged weapon attack (either manufactured or natural), that creature is entangled for 1 round. A wild shadow can have no more than one harried prey at a time and that creature must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, be he cannot select a new harried prey for 24 hours. If the wild shadow sees proof that his harried prey is dead, he can select a new harried prey after waiting 1 hour. This ability replaces the quarry class feature.</p>

Additionally, while he is within one of his favored terrains, if he gains concealment or total concealment, the miss chance of either type of concealment improves by 10%. Furthermore, at 16th level and 19th level, the bonuses granted by cover increase by 1 and the miss chance increases by another 10% (maximum +3 and +30% respectively at 20th level).

He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The isolation that some half-elves feel leads them to live a life of isolation amid the wild places of the world. Such rangers stalk the wild like shadows, creating close bonds with the wild itself instead of seeking the solace and aid of companions. While ill at ease within cities and other urban areas, they are adept at using the terrain to tactical advantage; they dart through brambles and rough terrain with uncommon grace and use the land itself to lock down enemies. A wild shadow has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Half-Elf</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Wild at Heart (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a wild shadow adds only 1/2 his class level when making wild empathy checks while in urban areas, and adds only 1/4 his class level to follow or identify tracks in such areas. In non-urban settings, he is considered two levels higher when determining the bonuses for such checks. This ability alters the track and wild empathy class features.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 3rd level, when a wild shadow chooses a favored terrain, he cannot choose urban as the terrain type. Furthermore, at 8th level and every five levels thereafter, when he chooses a new favorite terrain type, he cannot choose the urban terrain type. This ability alters the favored terrain class feature.</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>This ability functions as the 7th-level ranger class feature of the same name, but the wild shadow gains it at 4th level instead. This ability replaces the hunter&#146;s bond class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Unfettered Step (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a wild shadow&#146;s woodland stride class feature functions in any difficult terrain within any of his favored terrains, even in areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion. This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s woodland stride class feature gained at 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Harrying Attack (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a wild shadow can use his knowledge of terrain to make shrewd attacks in combat. Such attacks can make foes fumble or cause them to become entangled within areas of the wild shadow&#146;s favored terrain. As a standard action, the wild shadow denotes one target within line of sight and within one of his favored terrains as his harried prey. Once the foe is so designated, every time the wild shadow hits this harried prey with a melee or ranged weapon attack (either manufactured or natural), that creature is entangled for 1 round. A wild shadow can have no more than one harried prey at a time and that creature must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, be he cannot select a new harried prey for 24 hours. If the wild shadow sees proof that his harried prey is dead, he can select a new harried prey after waiting 1 hour. This ability replaces the quarry class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Stalker (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a wild shadow learns to better use natural surroundings to obscure his position in combat. Whenever a wild shadow is within one of his favored terrains and a feature of that terrain grants him cover, the bonuses to AC and Reflex saves for that cover improve by 1. Additionally, while he is within one of his favored terrains, if he gains concealment or total concealment, the miss chance of either type of concealment improves by 10%. Furthermore, at 16th level and 19th level, the bonuses granted by cover increase by 1 and the miss chance increases by another 10% (maximum +3 and +30% respectively at 20th level). This ability replaces the camouflage class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Master of Terrain (Ex): </b>At 19th level, a wild shadow can use his harrying attack against creatures other than his favored enemy or he can spend a standard action to designate up to two of his favored enemies as his harried prey instead. This ability replaces the improved quarry class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

				<name type="string">Hunter's Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A wild hunter seeks to emulate the animals around him to keep him safe while he tracks his prey. Instead of studying the traits and behaviors of a favored enemy, a wild hunter studies those of various animals, incorporating those attributes into his hunting strategy.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
					<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.)

					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>

				<name type="string">Hunter's Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

				<name type="string">Spells</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
					<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>At 7th level, a wave warden may move through any sort of aquatic growth (such as coral or seaweed) or across a wet surface at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.

This functions as summon nature&#146;s ally III, except it can only be used to summon creatures with the aquatic or water subtypes. At 11th level, this ability improves to summon nature&#146;s ally IV, with this progression continuing every three levels thereafter. The warden&#146;s caster level is equal to his ranger level.

					<p>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>

					<p>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The wave warden patrols beneath the sea, preserving the safety and secrets of merfolk communities. Though he fares best beneath the water, dry land is no haven to his quarry.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Merfolk</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Deep Sentinel (Ex): </b>A wave warden adds half his level (minimum +1) on Perception checks made to notice creatures underwater. This ability replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Aquatic Prowess Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level and every four levels thereafter, a wave warden selects a bonus feat that improves his prowess in aquatic environments. He can choose these feats even if he does not meet the prerequisites. Initially, he may choose from the following feats: Dodge, Mobility, Net Adept, Net and Trident, Net Maneuvering, Precise Shot, Rapid Reload, Sea Hunter, and Two-Weapon Fighting. At 6th level, he adds Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Net Trickery, and Spring Attack to the list. At 10th level, he adds Greater Two-Weapon Fighting and Improved Precise Shot to the list. This ability otherwise functions like and replaces the standard ranger&#146;s combat style bonus feats, including the limitations on armor worn.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 3rd level, a wave warden gains water as a favored terrain. At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, his bonus in aquatic terrain increases by +2. He does not gain additional favored terrains. This otherwise functions like the standard ranger&#146;s favored terrain ability and replaces that ability.</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Seaborn (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a wave warden may move through any sort of aquatic growth (such as coral or seaweed) or across a wet surface at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Obstacles that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Watery Summons (Sp): </b>At 8th level, a wave warden can summon allies once per day as a full-round action. This functions as summon nature&#146;s ally III, except it can only be used to summon creatures with the aquatic or water subtypes. At 11th level, this ability improves to summon nature&#146;s ally IV, with this progression continuing every three levels thereafter. The warden&#146;s caster level is equal to his ranger level. This ability replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>All rangers have a bond with the wilderness, but the warden may have the strongest. This protector sits guard in the middle of the wilderness, keeping a lookout for any dangers that might spill from the deeper wilderness beyond, and protecting civilization from the savagery of nature&#151;and vice versa. His long weeks, months, and sometimes years of isolation cause him to &#147;hear&#148; what the land is saying. Not all are crazy.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Master of Terrain (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a warden selects his first favored terrain. He gains another one at 3rd level, and then every five levels thereafter (for a maximum of five favored terrains at 18th level). This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s first favored enemy ability.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Live in Comfort (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a warden is truly at home within his favored terrains. He knows all the signs of the wilderness. He rarely gets lost. He can easily live off the land in comfort, and can provide for companions. The warden can take 10 on any Survival check involving any of his favored terrains, even when in immediate danger and distracted. If the warden is not in immediate danger and distracted, he can take 20 even if the check has a penalty for failure. This ability replaces all combat style feats.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Terrain Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a warden forms a bond with the land itself, enabling him to direct others in such terrain. When in his favored terrain, the warden grants all allies within line of sight and that can hear him a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. Also, as long as they travel with him, the warden&#146;s allies leave no trail and can&#146;t be tracked. The warden can choose for the group to leave a trail, or even for specific members of the group to leave a trail if he so desires. This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Able Explorer (Ex): </b>At 5th level, when making an Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, Ride, or Swim check in any of his favored terrains, a warden can make two skill checks and take the higher. This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s second, third, and fourth favored enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Wilderness Whispers (Su): </b>At 20th level, a warden cannot be surprised and always acts as if he had rolled a natural 20 on any initiative check while within any of his favored terrains.A warden can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s fifth favorite enemy and master hunter.</p>

This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>For the urban ranger, the streets and sewers of the city are just as dangerous as the barren wastelands or the deep forests. An urban ranger has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disable Device (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Community (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the urban ranger forms a bond with a community. While inside the limits of this community, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (local), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. An urban ranger traveling through his favored community leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (although he may leave a trail if he so desires).</p>
			<p>At 8th level, and every five levels thereafter, an urban ranger may select an additional favored community. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored community (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>For the purposes of this ability, a community is any settlement consisting of 100 or more individuals. The community may be larger than this minimum. Outlying farms, fields, and houses are not considered part of a community. This ability replaces favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an urban ranger can find and disable traps, as the rogue class feature of the same name. This ability replaces endurance.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Push Through (Ex): </b>At 7th level, an urban ranger is never slowed by difficult terrain in his favored communities. In addition, he can move through the space occupied by local citizens as if they were allies. This does not apply to creatures intent on harming the ranger. Areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him. This replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Blend In (Ex): </b>An urban ranger of 12th level or higher can use his Stealth bonus in place of a Disguise skill check in any of his favored communities. This disguise does not take an action to don. He must make a check whenever someone attempts to pick him out from the local citizens. If his check is successful, he blends into the crowd. While not invisible, enemies do not notice his presence and take no actions against him unless they are taking actions against the local citizens in general. This replaces camouflage.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Invisibility Trick (Sp): </b>At 17th level, the urban ranger can cast greater invisibility on himself as a wizard of his ranger level as a swift action. He can use this spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This ability replaces hide in plain sight.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some rangers have taken up the mysteries of black powder in order to become big game hunters. Finding firearms useful for taking down large and dangerous prey, they enter the fight with the crack of black powder fire, often ranging far and wide in their safaris and searches for ever-more-dangerous denizens of the wild to track, study, appreciate&#151;and kill. While this might strike some as going against the ranger&#146;s usual respect for nature and the creatures of the wild, trophy hunters understand that they are just more pieces in nature&#146;s grand puzzle, and that the laws of the jungle&#151;the right to kill and feed on those weaker than you, and the need to establish dominance through cunning and bloodshed&#151;are both their rights and their duty as the current top of the food chain.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>

			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Improved Tracking (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a trophy hunter gains a +2 bonus on Survival skill checks when following or identifying tracks. When he tracks, he can also attempt a Knowledge (nature) check at DC 15. On a success, the trophy hunter can discern the type and condition of any animals or magical beasts he tracks. By studying their tracks, the trophy hunter is able to identify a rough approximation of their health, maneuverability, and their general behavior as compared to the norm. This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Firearm Style: </b>At 2nd level, a trophy hunter gains the Amateur Gunslinger feat and Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms), and can use any 1st-level gunslinger deed (page 10). At every four levels thereafter, the trophy hunter can take a grit feat or select a gunslinger deed of his level or lower, ranger&#146;s choice. This ability replaces all combat style feats.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter&#146;s Aim (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a trophy hunter gains a specific understanding of the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of his favored enemies, and his careful study of these enemies reveals the best way to hurt them. When the trophy hunter makes a firearm attack against a favored enemy, he can target touch AC in the first two range increments of his firearm. This ability stacks with other effects that increase the range increments to target touch AC, adding one range increment to the effect. This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

				<name type="string">Hunter's Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

				<name type="string">Spells</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
					<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>

					<p>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While many rangers use bows and arrows, the toxophilite takes special pride in her skill at archery. The toxophilite emulates the sharpshooting rangers of legend, who could pin a fly to the wall with a single shot or split one arrow with another. A truly talented toxophilite can even shoot down an enemy&#146;s arrow while it&#146;s still in flight.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Arrow-Splitter (Ex): </b>A toxophilite gains a +1 bonus on ranged attack rolls against creatures or objects two or more size categories smaller than her. The toxophilite&#146;s ranged attacks also deal full damage to objects instead of half damage. This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a toxophilite must select one of two ranged combat styles to pursue: archery or crossbow. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Intercept Arrow (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a toxophilite can ready a ranged attack to deflect a ranged weapon attack against her or an ally within 30 feet. To deflect the attack, the toxophilite makes an attack with a ranged weapon. If her attack roll is greater than the attacking opponent&#146;s roll, the opponent&#146;s initial attack automatically misses. For each size category the attacking creature is larger than the toxophilite, the toxophilite takes a &#150;4 penalty on her attack roll. The toxophilite must declare the use of this ability after the attack is announced, but before the roll is made. Unusually massive ranged weapons, such as boulders or ballista bolts, and ranged attacks by firearms or generated by natural attacks or spell effects can&#146;t be deflected. This ability replaces endurance.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Intercept (Ex): </b>At 11th level, when the toxophilite takes a full-attack action with a ranged weapon, she can choose to forgo one of her attacks. If she does so, she can use her intercept arrow ability as an immediate action instead of a readied action at any time before her next turn. Her attack roll to intercept uses the same bonuses as the attack she chose to forgo during her previous action. This ability replaces quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Intercept (Ex): </b>At 19th level, whenever a toxophilite successfully def lects an attack with her intercept arrow ability, she can redirect the attack against a target within 30 feet, using the intercepted attack&#146;s attack roll against the new target&#146;s AC. This ability replaces improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Saviors and destroyers in equal measure, toxic herbalists use nature&#146;s bounty to craft remedies and poisons.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Toxic Touch (Ex): </b>A toxic herbalist studies the safe handling of deadly substances. He cannot accidentally poison himself when he applies poison to a weapon.</p>
			<p>This replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Nature&#146;s Mercy (Ex and Su): </b>At 3rd level, a toxic herbalist&#146;s knowledge of the natural world offers respite from wounds and illness. Once per day, he can spend 1 hour in a wilderness area gathering herbs and other natural materials and combine them into a medicinal poultice&#151;this hour can be integrated with the hour required for the ranger to prepare spells.</p>
			<p>Placing the poultice on a wound or ingesting it is a standard action; the creature receiving the poultice heals a number of hit points equal to 1d6 + the ranger&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the ranger creates one additional poultice when using this ability, to a maximum of four at 18th level. Poultices remain potent for 1 hour.</p>
			<p>Additionally, at 8th level, the poultice neutralizes one poison affecting the recipient, as per neutralize poison. At 13th level, it also attempts to cure one disease affecting the recipient, as per remove disease. The caster level of both of these effects is equal to the toxic herbalist&#146;s level. These additional effects are supernatural effects.</p>
			<p>This replaces endurance.</p>
			<p><b>Sudden Onset (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a toxic herbalist can administer a poultice he created via nature&#146;s mercy or poison a weapon as a swift action. Additionally, the toxic herbalist adds the following spells to the ranger spell list at the indicated spell levels: 1st&#151;nauseating dart, ray of sickening; 2nd&#151;pernicious poison, pox pustules; 3rd&#151; poison, toxic gift; 4th&#151;absorb toxicity, cloudkill.</p>
			<p>This replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Grim Harvest (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a toxic herbalist can spend 1 hour foraging for poisonous substances to create a dose of poison (this hour can be integrated with the hour required to prepare spells or poultices). The toxic herbalist rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Intelligence modifier. The DC of this check is equal to the Craft DC of the poison he wishes to create. If he succeeds at this check, the ranger creates 1 dose of the chosen poison. The poison remains potent for a number of hours equal to the toxic herbalist&#146;s level, regardless of the means used in attempts to preserve it, and it can&#146;t be sold. This ability functions only while the toxic herbalist is within one of his favored terrains.</p>
			<p>This replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Potent Venom (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a toxic herbalist&#146;s poisons become even deadlier. When he poisons a favored enemy, the DC of the poison&#146;s saving throw increases by half the toxic herbalist&#146;s favored enemy bonus against that target.</p>
			<p>This replaces quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Poisonous Reaper (Ex): </b>At 19th level, a single dose of poison on a toxic herbalist&#146;s weapon remains potent for the entirety of a full attack, instead of for a single strike.</p>
			<p>This replaces improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

				<name type="string">Hunter's Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The tidal hunter draws strength from the fish and other wildlife of the deep.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Keen Scent (Ex): </b>A tidal hunter gains scent, as per the universal monster rule. At 12th level, while in water, the tidal hunter can detect particularly strong or distinct odors (such as blood) up to 1 mile away.</p>
			<p>This replaces track and camouflage.</p>
			<p><b>Waterborn (Su): </b>A tidal hunter can breathe water for up to 10 minutes per ranger level each day. At 6th level, he can breathe underwater indefinitely.</p>
			<p>This replaces wild empathy and the 6th-level combat style feat.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Aquatic Mastery (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a tidal hunter must select water as his favored terrain, and he doesn&#146;t gain additional favored terrains. At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the bonus from this favored terrain increases by 2.</p>
			<p>This alters favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Wave Rush (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a tidal hunter gains a swim speed equal to his base speed. If he already has a swim speed, it increases by 10 feet.</p>
			<p>This replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Tidal Surge (Sp): </b>At 16th level, a tidal hunter gains control over water, and he can use the tides to attack his foes. Once per day, he can cast tidal surge as a spell-like ability.</p>
			<p>This replaces improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a Tanglebriar demonslayer must choose favored enemy (evil outsider). At 5th level and every time he advances his favored enemy bonus, the demonslayer must advance his bonus against evil outsiders. In addition to the normal benefits of favored enemy, a Tanglebriar demonslayer gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his favored enemy bonus on saving throws against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of evil outsiders. This ability is otherwise identical to and replaces the favored enemy ranger class ability.</p>
					<p>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
					<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

					<p>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>During the elves&#146; long absence from Golarion, the nascent demon lord Treerazer took up residence in the Fierani Forest in what is now the Elven kingdom of Kyonin. Eventually, the demon&#146;s presence in the forest drew the elves back to Golarion, who sought to purge the fiendish blight from this once-sacred land. They defeated Treerazer but could not destroy him, forcing him instead into the southern reaches of the Fierani, a corrupted region of twisted plants and fiendish denizens called Tanglebriar. Even today, the elves constantly battle to keep the corruption in the Tanglebriar from spreading to the rest of the Fierani Forest and beyond. Though they are sworn foes of Treerazer and his kin, Tanglebriar demonslayers are known to venture forth from Kyonin to broaden their expertise in the destruction of demons.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a Tanglebriar demonslayer must choose favored enemy (evil outsider). At 5th level and every time he advances his favored enemy bonus, the demonslayer must advance his bonus against evil outsiders. In addition to the normal benefits of favored enemy, a Tanglebriar demonslayer gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his favored enemy bonus on saving throws against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of evil outsiders. This ability is otherwise identical to and replaces the favored enemy ranger class ability.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Demonologist (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a Tanglebriar demonslayer gains insight into his Abyssal enemies. The demonslayer gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level on Knowledge (planes) checks that relate to demons, Perception checks to pierce a demon&#146;s disguise, and Survival checks while tracking demons. This bonus stacks with any bonuses from favored enemy. This ability replaces endurance.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Expanded Spell List: </b>A Tanglebriar demonslayer adds the following spells to his spell list: 1st&#151;protection from evil; 2nd&#151;align weapon, magic circle against evil; 4th&#151; dimensional anchor, dismissal.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Quarry (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a Tanglebriar demonslayer chooses an evil outsider as his quarry, he can the forgo the normal +2 attack bonus and instead treat his weapon as if it were good-aligned versus his quarry. This ability is otherwise identical to quarry and replaces that ability.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Fiendish Quarry (Su): </b>At 19th level, when a Tanglebriar demonslayer chooses an evil outsider as his quarry, he can forgo the normal +4 attack bonus and instead treat his weapon as if it had the holy weapon special ability while attacking his quarry. This ability is otherwise identical to improved quarry and replaces that ability. At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
					<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Agile, vengeful, and deadly, a sword-devil ?ghts with precision and grace, channeling the difficult lessons of a star-crossed life into unparalleled battle prowess. Favoring speed and evasive techniques over brute force, sword-devils choose precision over power and acrobatics over armor. Charismatic and carefree, a sword-devil makes fast friends and inspires her companions to greatness, even while vowing a swift death upon her enemies.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Death Vow (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a sword-devil may, as a swift action, focus all her fury and determination on a single foe she swears to slay. She may do this once per day, plus one additional time per day at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter (7th, 10th, etc). The sword-devil gains a bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against her sworn target equal to half her sword-devil level (minimum +1). The death vow effect remains until the target of the death vow is dead, or the next time the sword-devil rests and regains use of this ability.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces favored enemy.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Slashing Fury (Ex): </b>Beginning at 3rd level, the sword-devil can use her Charisma score in place of her Intelligence score as a prerequisite for combat feats. Additionally, she selects one type of light or one- handed slashing melee weapon. When using this weapon, she may use her Dexterity modi?er instead of her Strength modi?er on melee attack rolls. At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter (13th and 18th). the sword-devil may select an additional type of light or one-handed slashing weapon she may use with this ability. This ability counts as having the Weapon Finesse feat for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiring Example (Ex): </b>At 4th level, the sword-devil forms a bond with her companions, inspiring them to greater zeal in combat by the example of her weaponcraft. As a standard action, the sword-devil may grant half her death vow bonus against a single victim of her death vow to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the sword-devil's Charisma modi?er (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any death vow bonuses possessed by the sword-devil&#145;s allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces hunter's bond.</p>
			<p><b>Untouchable (Ex): </b>At 4th level. the sword-devil's con?dence and personality distract her foes in combat, making her more difficult to hit. When unarmored and unencumbered. the sword-devil may add her Charisma bonus (ifany) to her AC and her CMD. In addition, the sword-devil gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC at 6th level, and every three sword-devil levels thereafter (9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th). She loses these bonuses when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carriers a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces spells.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Second Combat Style (Ex): </b>At 11th level, the sword-devil chooses a second ranger combat style. When she recieves a bonus combat feat, she may select any feat from either combat style's list.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Seething Fury (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the sword-devil's countless battles harden her soul and make her lose touch with her humanity. Her growing lack of control over her wrath fuels the potency of her death vow. She adds her Charisma bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against targets of her death vow, and automatically con?rms threatened critical hits against them.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Avatar of Vengeance (Su): </b>A sword-devil of 20th level becomes a living avatar of vengeance, infused with supernatural powers that push her beyond the mortal. Recognized for her battle prowess and unparalleled skill at killing by a potent otherworldly entity. The sword-devil becomes the living vessel of an immortal, intangible, and inscrutable being obsessed only with slaying her foes, meting out violent retribution to those who have wronged her, or simply dispatching her enemies in dazzling display of wanton destruction. As a standard action, the sword-devil allows herself to be infused with this killing spirit. She gains a fly speed of 60-feet (perfect), a +6 morale bonus to AC, and ?re resistance 30- This ability can be used for 10 minutes per day. but it must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces master hunter.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
					<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

Each creature in the area takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage and is pushed to the end of the cone.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some rangers eschew the path of the swift skirmisher and embrace the implacable strength of the mountain.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Roots of the Mountain (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a summit sentinel gains Toughness as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p>Additionally, as a move action, she can enter a defensive stance for 1 minute. While in this stance, the summit sentinel&#146;s speed is reduced to 5 feet, she gains a +2 enhancement bonus to her natural armor, and she gains a +2 bonus to her CMD against maneuvers that would move her or knock her prone. If the ranger loses contact with the ground or other solid surface, the stance ends immediately. The ranger can enter this stance a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Constitution modifier.</p>
			<p>At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the enhancement bonus to natural armor increases by 1, and the bonus to CMD increases by 2.</p>
			<p>This replaces the ranger&#146;s combat style feats.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Mountain Mastery (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a summit sentinel must select mountains as her favored terrain, and she does not gain additional favored terrains at higher levels. Every 5 levels beyond 5th, the bonus from this favored terrain increases by 2.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a summit sentinel draws strength from the earth. When she and her target are both in contact with the ground or an earthen floor, the summit sentinel gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against the target. At 18th level, the bonus on attack and damage rolls increases to +2.</p>
			<p>This alters favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>A summit sentinel adds stoneskin to the ranger spell list as a 4th-level spell.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Rockslide (Su): </b>At 8th level, once per day as a standard action, a summit sentinel can create a rushing wave of earth and stone. The summit sentinel chooses a point on the ground or floor within 30 feet. Rippling waves of earth and stone emanate from the chosen point in a 25-foot cone in a direction of the summit sentinel&#146;s choice. Each creature in the area takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage and is pushed to the end of the cone. A target that succeeds at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the ranger&#146;s level + the ranger&#146;s Wisdom modifier) takes half damage and is not pushed.</p>
			<p>This replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Invincible (Su): </b>At 17th level, a summit sentinel takes on the unyielding hardness of the mountains. While in her roots of the mountain defensive stance, she is immune to critical hits and precision damage.</p>
			<p>This replaces hide in plain sight.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Rangers who walk in the tempest unafraid draw the power of the storm into themselves and become stormwalkers.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a stormwalker must choose archery style. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Thundershot (Su): </b>At 4th level, a stormwalker can wreathe his weapon in lightning. As a standard action, he can grant a single weapon he holds the shock special ability for 1 minute; while under this effect, the weapon counts as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A stormwalker can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier. At 12th level, weapons affected by this ability gain the shocking burst special ability.</p>
			<p>This replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Wind Treader (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a stormwalker becomes immune to the effects of strong wind. He can move without hindrance in windy conditions, and his ranged attacks take no penalties from nonmagical wind.</p>
			<p>This replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Flash Step (Su): </b>At 11th level, a stormwalker can move across the battlefield like a bolt of lightning. As a full-round action, he can transform into lightning and move to any unoccupied square within 60 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity. He can make a single ranged attack before or after this movement.</p>
			<p>This replaces quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Control Weather (Sp): </b>At 16th level, a stormwalker can cast control weather as a spell-like ability once per day.</p>
			<p>This replaces improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Flash Shot (Su): </b>At 19th level, when a stormwalker uses flash step, he can make a ranged attack both before and after his movement. Both of these attacks are made at his highest base attack bonus.</p>
			<p>This replaces improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, instead of forming a bond with his hunting companions or an animal companion, the spirit ranger forms a bond with the spirits of nature themselves. Each day, as long as he is within one of his favored terrains, the ranger can cast augury (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 245) as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to his ranger level. In addition, he can call upon these spirits to cast any one ranger spell that he is capable of casting, without having to prepare the spell. At 8th level, and every four levels thereafter, he can cast an additional spell in this way. This replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
					<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>

Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>

If he is within one of his favored terrains, the ranger can cast divination (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 273) instead. Like augury, the caster level of the divination is equal to the ranger&#146;s level. This ability replaces camouflage.</p>

He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>

					<p>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, instead of forming a bond with his hunting companions or an animal companion, the spirit ranger forms a bond with the spirits of nature themselves. Each day, as long as he is within one of his favored terrains, the ranger can cast augury (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 245) as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to his ranger level. In addition, he can call upon these spirits to cast any one ranger spell that he is capable of casting, without having to prepare the spell. At 8th level, and every four levels thereafter, he can cast an additional spell in this way. This replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Wisdom of the Spirits (Sp): </b>At 12th level, the spirit ranger can use his augury spell-like ability even when he is not in one of his favored terrains. If he is within one of his favored terrains, the ranger can cast divination (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 273) instead. Like augury, the caster level of the divination is equal to the ranger&#146;s level. This ability replaces camouflage.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills).

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

A ranger can use these tricks a total number of times per day equal to 1/2 his ranger level + his Wisdom modifier. Tricks are usually swift actions, but sometimes move or free actions that modify a standard action, usually an attack action. Once a trick is chosen, it can&#146;t be retrained. A ranger cannot select an individual trick more than once. This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s spells class feature. Skirmishers do not gain any spells or spellcasting ability, do not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger and spell completion magic items.</p>

In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours.

He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Many rangers rely on spells, but there are some who eschew aid from divine powers for their own reasons. Skirmishers rely on their wits, their wisdom, and sometimes even instinct to aid in their quests. A skirmisher has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter&#146;s Tricks: </b>At 5th level, a skirmisher ranger learns the use of hunter&#146;s tricks, which typically grant a boon or bonus to the ranger or a nearby ally. At 5th level, the ranger learns one trick, selected from the list below. At 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, he learns another trick. A ranger can use these tricks a total number of times per day equal to 1/2 his ranger level + his Wisdom modifier. Tricks are usually swift actions, but sometimes move or free actions that modify a standard action, usually an attack action. Once a trick is chosen, it can&#146;t be retrained. A ranger cannot select an individual trick more than once. This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s spells class feature. Skirmishers do not gain any spells or spellcasting ability, do not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger and spell completion magic items.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level, the shapeshifter can take on the aspects of a wild creature once per day as a swift action. He can remain in this form for a number of rounds equal to his ranger level + his Wisdom modifier. While in one of his shifter&#146;s blessing forms, the ranger gains the shapeshifter subtype.</p>
					<p>The shapeshifter must choose one of the following forms. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>Form of the Bear: The ranger&#146;s muscles enlarge and tighten, and his facial features become more ursine. While in this form, the ranger gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but his base speed becomes 20 feet.</p>
					<p>Form of the Cat: The ranger&#146;s muscles become lean and defined, and his gait more deliberate and graceful. While in this form, the ranger increases his base speed by 10 feet, and he gains a +4 bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks.</p>
					<p>Form of the Dragon: The ranger&#146;s skin becomes rough and scaly. While in this form, the ranger gains a +2 natural armor bonus to AC.</p>
					<p>Form of the Eagle: The ranger&#146;s skin stretches, his nose becomes hooked, and his eyes enlarge. While in this form, the ranger gains a +10 bonus on Perception checks.</p>
					<p>Form of the Jackal: The ranger becomes thin and hyperactive, his movements taking on a nervous spryness. While in this form, the ranger can spend a move action to move up to 1/2 his speed without provoking attacks of opportunity.</p>
					<p>Form of the Otter: The ranger&#146;s hands and feet grow webs, and his body grows an oily fur that is water resistant. While in this form, the ranger gains a swim speed of 30 feet and a +8 bonus on Swim checks.</p>
					<p>At 8th level and again every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional form for his shifter&#146;s blessing and may use this ability one additional time per day. This is not a polymorph ability; a ranger with shifter&#146;s blessing in one of his shifted forms can be affected by a polymorph ability and retain his bonus and traits gained by the class feature. This ability replaces favored terrain.</p>

				<level type="number">4</level>
				<name type="string">Hunter's Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

				<name type="string">Spells</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
					<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>

Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>

The ranger&#146;s forms from shifter&#146;s blessing improve to the following:</p>
					<p>Form of the Bear: The ranger&#146;s muscles enlarge and tighten, and his facial features become more ursine.

					<p>Form of the Eagle: The ranger&#146;s skin stretches, his nose becomes hooked, and his eyes enlarge. While in this form, the ranger gains a +10 bonus on Perception checks and a fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of an eagle or similar raptor as if the caster of beast shape IV.</p>
					<p>Form of the Jackal: The ranger becomes thin and hyperactive, his movements taking on a nervous spryness. While in this form, the ranger does not provoke attacks of opportunity due to movement. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of a jackal or other canine creature as if the caster of beast shape IV.</p>
					<p>Form of the Otter: The ranger&#146;s hands and feet grow webs, and his body grows an oily fur that is water resistant. While in this form, the ranger gains a swim speed of 60 feet and a +5 bonus on Swim checks.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Most rangers venture into the wilderness, but there are some who let the wilderness seep into them. Whether by curse, disease, ancient rite, a slight lycanthropic influence in the blood, or the corrupting influence of chaos, these rangers embrace the wild to transform themselves into something untamed and feral. Shapeshifters are often held in awe, but are even more often feared. A shapeshifter has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a shapeshifter ranger must choose the natural weapon combat style. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Blessing (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the shapeshifter can take on the aspects of a wild creature once per day as a swift action. He can remain in this form for a number of rounds equal to his ranger level + his Wisdom modifier. While in one of his shifter&#146;s blessing forms, the ranger gains the shapeshifter subtype.</p>
			<p>The shapeshifter must choose one of the following forms. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><i>Form of the Bear: </i>The ranger&#146;s muscles enlarge and tighten, and his facial features become more ursine. While in this form, the ranger gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but his base speed becomes 20 feet.</p>
			<p><i>Form of the Cat: </i>The ranger&#146;s muscles become lean and defined, and his gait more deliberate and graceful. While in this form, the ranger increases his base speed by 10 feet, and he gains a +4 bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks.</p>
			<p><i>Form of the Dragon: </i>The ranger&#146;s skin becomes rough and scaly. While in this form, the ranger gains a +2 natural armor bonus to AC.</p>
			<p><i>Form of the Eagle: </i>The ranger&#146;s skin stretches, his nose becomes hooked, and his eyes enlarge. While in this form, the ranger gains a +10 bonus on Perception checks.</p>
			<p><i>Form of the Jackal: </i>The ranger becomes thin and hyperactive, his movements taking on a nervous spryness. While in this form, the ranger can spend a move action to move up to 1/2 his speed without provoking attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p><i>Form of the Otter: </i>The ranger&#146;s hands and feet grow webs, and his body grows an oily fur that is water resistant. While in this form, the ranger gains a swim speed of 30 feet and a +8 bonus on Swim checks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level and again every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional form for his shifter&#146;s blessing and may use this ability one additional time per day. This is not a polymorph ability; a ranger with shifter&#146;s blessing in one of his shifted forms can be affected by a polymorph ability and retain his bonus and traits gained by the class feature. This ability replaces favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Form Shifter (Ex): </b>At 12th level, when the shapeshifter takes on a shifter&#146;s blessing form, he can take on a hybrid of two of his forms. He gains the bonuses for both forms. This ability replaces camouflage.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Shifter (Su): </b>At 20th level, the ranger&#146;s shifter&#146;s blessing forms improve, and he can take on true forms of beasts. The ranger can use dual form shifter with this ability, although he cannot use more than one polymorph effect at any one time. This ability replaces master hunter. The ranger&#146;s forms from shifter&#146;s blessing improve to the following:</p>
			<p><i>Form of the Bear: </i>The ranger&#146;s muscles enlarge and tighten, and his facial features become more ursine. While in this form, the ranger gains a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength and he does not suffer any reduction of speed. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of a bear as if the caster of beast shape IV.</p>
			<p><i>Form of the Cat: </i>The ranger&#146;s muscles become lean and defined, and his gait more deliberate and graceful. While in this form, the ranger increases his base speed by 20 feet and he gains a +10 bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of a cat of any size as if the caster of beast shape IV.</p>
			<p><i>Form of the Dragon: </i>The ranger&#146;s skin becomes rough and scaly. While in this form, the ranger gains a +4 natural armor bonus to AC and a fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability. Alternately, the ranger can polymorph into the form of a dragon as if the caster of form of the dragon I.</p>
			<p><i>Form of the Eagle: </i>The ranger&#146;s skin stretches, his nose becomes hooked, and his eyes enlarge. While in this form, the ranger gains a +10 bonus on Perception checks and a fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of an eagle or similar raptor as if the caster of beast shape IV.</p>
			<p><i>Form of the Jackal: </i>The ranger becomes thin and hyperactive, his movements taking on a nervous spryness. While in this form, the ranger does not provoke attacks of opportunity due to movement. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of a jackal or other canine creature as if the caster of beast shape IV.</p>
			<p><i>Form of the Otter: </i>The ranger&#146;s hands and feet grow webs, and his body grows an oily fur that is water resistant. While in this form, the ranger gains a swim speed of 60 feet and a +5 bonus on Swim checks. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of an otter or similar river mammal as if the caster of beast shape IV.</p>

				<name type="string">Sense Intruder</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 6th level, a sentinel gains the ability to establish an incredibly effective watch by standing still and focusing on all of her senses as once. At any time, she can spend 1 minute setting up this ability. Once she has done so, she must stand still, taking no other actions except to keep track of her surroundings; she can&#146;t even take free actions like talking. Her heightened senses grant her a supernatural awareness of her surroundings within 20 feet. If any Tiny or larger creature enters the area over which her awareness extends, she automatically knows that it did so (this part of the ability is a divination effect and can&#146;t be deceived by spells that block sensory input, only by extreme effects like mind blank). Furthermore, unless that creature is simultaneously negating its visual, auditory, and scent stimuli (such as by being under invisibility, silence, and negate aromaAPG all at once), the sentinel can attempt a Perception check as an immediate action to pinpoint the intruder&#146;s location, ignoring any Stealth bonuses the intruder might gain from effects that obscure only one of those senses, such as invisibility, camouflage, or other spells or abilities.</p>
					<p>This sort of heightened analysis of sensory stimuli is taxing, as much so as hustling overland for an equivalent period of time, despite not moving from a single spot. The sentinel can use this ability for 1 hour without penalty. Using sense intruder for a second hour in between sleep cycles deals 1 point of nonlethal damage to the sentinel, and each additional hour deals twice the damage taken during the previous hour. A sentinel who takes any nonlethal damage from using this ability becomes fatigued. Each hour the sentinel uses sense intruder also counts as 1 hour of hustling overland for the purpose of determining how much nonlethal damage the sentinel takes in a single day.</p>
					<p>Starting at 10th level, whenever the sentinel gains a combat style feat, she can choose to trade it for a 10-foot increase in the radius of this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A sentinel specializes in heightening all of her senses to expose spies and those who work for opposing factions, rooting out all who attempt to slip past her evervigilant watch. Her uncanny skills are in ready demand by city guards, business owners, and even criminal organizations that desire to keep the authorities out of their disreputable affairs.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>

			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Mugshot (Sp): </b>A sentinel can spend 1 minute studying the appearance of a target or a likeness of the target in the form of a picture, carving, or visual illusion and memorize it with perfect recall. From that point on, the sentinel gains a +4 bonus on Perception checks to notice the target in disguise or pick him out of a crowd. The sentinel is automatically allowed a Perception check against the target&#146;s Disguise check whenever she sees the target, even if the individual isn&#146;t doing anything to draw attention to himself. A sentinel can memorize the appearance of a number of targets equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) at any given time. Once a sentinel has reached her maximum number of memorized appearances, she must forget one of the memorized faces before gaining a new one.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Uncanny Alertness (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a sentinel is always ready to defend against incoming attacks. A sentinel is never flat-footed before acting in combat, even if she is surprised (she can still become flat-footed by any other effect or situation that would render her flat-footed).</p>
			<p>At 7th level, the sentinel also always acts on the surprise round. If she would have acted on the surprise round anyway, or if there is no surprise round, she gains a bonus on initiative checks equal to half her ranger level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces a ranger&#146;s hunter&#146;s bond and woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Sense Intruder (Su): </b>At 6th level, a sentinel gains the ability to establish an incredibly effective watch by standing still and focusing on all of her senses as once. At any time, she can spend 1 minute setting up this ability. Once she has done so, she must stand still, taking no other actions except to keep track of her surroundings; she can&#146;t even take free actions like talking. Her heightened senses grant her a supernatural awareness of her surroundings within 20 feet. If any Tiny or larger creature enters the area over which her awareness extends, she automatically knows that it did so (this part of the ability is a divination effect and can&#146;t be deceived by spells that block sensory input, only by extreme effects like mind blank). Furthermore, unless that creature is simultaneously negating its visual, auditory, and scent stimuli (such as by being under invisibility, silence, and negate aromaAPG all at once), the sentinel can attempt a Perception check as an immediate action to pinpoint the intruder&#146;s location, ignoring any Stealth bonuses the intruder might gain from effects that obscure only one of those senses, such as invisibility, camouflage, or other spells or abilities.</p>
			<p>This sort of heightened analysis of sensory stimuli is taxing, as much so as hustling overland for an equivalent period of time, despite not moving from a single spot. The sentinel can use this ability for 1 hour without penalty. Using sense intruder for a second hour in between sleep cycles deals 1 point of nonlethal damage to the sentinel, and each additional hour deals twice the damage taken during the previous hour. A sentinel who takes any nonlethal damage from using this ability becomes fatigued. Each hour the sentinel uses sense intruder also counts as 1 hour of hustling overland for the purpose of determining how much nonlethal damage the sentinel takes in a single day.</p>
			<p>Starting at 10th level, whenever the sentinel gains a combat style feat, she can choose to trade it for a 10-foot increase in the radius of this ability.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the combat style feat gained at 6th level and alters combat style feats</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Mugshot Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, the sentinel can activate her quarry ability (and her improved quarry ability at 19th level) against any of the targets she has memorized with the mugshot ability, even if the creature in question is not within her line of sight.</p>
			<p>This ability alters quarry and improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

				<name type="string">Hunter's Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours.

The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Sable Company marines receive their training at the elite Endrin Military Academy in Korvosa. A large portion of their education is the handling and riding of hippogriffs, the iconic mounts of members of the company.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Hippogriff Companion: </b>At 2nd level, a Sable Company marine adds Monstrous Mount (see page 14) to the list of bonus feats made available to him by his chosen combat style, regardless of the style chosen. He can only use this feat to select a hippogriff mount (see page 14). If he does so, he treats his ranger level &#150; 1 as his effective druid level. A marine who takes this option does not gain the hunter&#146;s bond class feature at 4th level.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a Sable Company marine adds Monstrous Mount Mastery (see page 14) to the list of available bonus feats granted by his chosen combat style. If he takes this feat as his 6th-level combat style bonus feat, note that he must wait until 8th level before he meets the effective druid level prerequisite to utilize his mount&#146;s mastery abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A realm wanderer adds half his level (minimum 1) to Diplomacy checks to influence a creature&#146;s attitude, to make requests of creatures, and for similar uses of the skill. He also adds half his level (minimum 1) to Bluff checks to deceive, lie, or convey secret messages.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

				<name type="string">Hunter's Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

				<name type="string">Spells</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
					<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours.

					<p>At 20th level, the realm wanderer has become a true master of the territories with which he is familiar. As a standard action, he can make a single attack at his full attack bonus against an enemy in one of the terrains chosen using the dual master ability. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or die. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + half the realm wanderer&#146;s level + his Wisdom modifier. A realm wanderer can instead deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature&#146;s current hit points; the target can attempt a Fortitude save at the same DC to negates this damage.

					<p>At 4th level, a realm wanderer must choose an animal companion for his hunter&#146;s bond. This animal companion gains the fiendish template, likely either due to time it spent near a gate to Hell or due to infernal influences in its place of birth. Due to this insidious influence, this animal companion always takes a penalty on attack rolls equal to one-fifth of the realm wanderer&#146;s level (minimum 1).</p>
					<p>If the realm wanderer releases his animal companion from service or it perishes, he can gain a new fiendish animal companion by completing the required ceremony. Alternatively, when the realm wanderer releases his animal companion or it dies in his service, he can use his influence over its fiendish nature to cause the animal to lose the fiendish template. If the animal companion is then raised or otherwise brought back from the dead after the realm wanderer removes its fiendish template, the animal companion no longer takes the penalty on attacks described above. (He cannot, however, gain a new non-fiendish animal companion by completing the ceremony to replace an animal companion.)</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some of the most free-roaming rangers are those who tread between locales so varied that they may as well be separate worlds altogether&#151;and quite often these disparate places are literally Hell and the Material Plane. Like the Queen of Dis, whom many of them admire, these rangers take to heart the lessons they&#146;ve learned from their vastly contrasting experiences and know that creatively embracing this wisdom is sometimes the difference between life and death.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Deceptive Subtlety (Ex): </b>A realm wanderer adds half his level (minimum 1) to Diplomacy checks to influence a creature&#146;s attitude, to make requests of creatures, and for similar uses of the skill. He also adds half his level (minimum 1) to Bluff checks to deceive, lie, or convey secret messages.</p>
			<p>This replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Queen&#146;s Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a realm wanderer must choose an animal companion for his hunter&#146;s bond. This animal companion gains the fiendish template, likely either due to time it spent near a gate to Hell or due to infernal influences in its place of birth. Due to this insidious influence, this animal companion always takes a penalty on attack rolls equal to one-fifth of the realm wanderer&#146;s level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>If the realm wanderer releases his animal companion from service or it perishes, he can gain a new fiendish animal companion by completing the required ceremony. Alternatively, when the realm wanderer releases his animal companion or it dies in his service, he can use his influence over its fiendish nature to cause the animal to lose the fiendish template. If the animal companion is then raised or otherwise brought back from the dead after the realm wanderer removes its fiendish template, the animal companion no longer takes the penalty on attacks described above. (He cannot, however, gain a new non-fiendish animal companion by completing the ceremony to replace an animal companion.)</p>
			<p>This alters hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Master (Ex): </b>At 8th level, the realm wanderer&#146;s bonuses from deceptive subtlety are doubled when he is in either of his two favored terrain types. However, this benefit applies only to the first two favored terrain types he selected; as he gains additional favored terrains at higher levels, this benefit does not apply in those additional terrain types.</p>
			<p>This replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Shrewdest Monarch (Su): </b>At 20th level, the realm wanderer has become a true master of the territories with which he is familiar. As a standard action, he can make a single attack at his full attack bonus against an enemy in one of the terrains chosen using the dual master ability. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or die. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + half the realm wanderer&#146;s level + his Wisdom modifier. A realm wanderer can instead deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature&#146;s current hit points; the target can attempt a Fortitude save at the same DC to negates this damage. The realm wanderer can use this ability in these favored terrains only up to four times per day, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>
			<p>Further, the realm wanderer gains a bonus on attack rolls equal to his Wisdom modifier against creatures that have successfully learned his alignment (using detect chaos/evil/good/law, as appropriate, or similar effects).</p>
			<p>This replaces master hunter.</p>

					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

				<name type="string">Hunter's Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

				<name type="string">Spells</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types.

The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While the Silver Ravens adopted their name as a way to honor the group of adventurers who defended Kintargo during the Chelish Civil War, some Silver Ravens have gone even farther, breeding and training actual ravens to serve both as living symbols of the organization and as fearsome weapons against House Thrune and its diabolic servants. These rangers, known as raven masters, eschew a ranger&#146;s usual connection to the natural world to form a mystic bond with their birds and to grant both animal and master a number of specialized abilities. Over time, the feathers of these raven companions take on a silvery sheen, causing them to resemble the birds produced by the figurines of wondrous power, which served as the original Silver Ravens&#146; namesake.</i></p>
			<p><i>Raven masters serve as messengers and spies for the Silver Ravens, using their ravens to scout the border between Ravounel and Cheliax and report any suspicious Thrune troop movements. Outside of Cheliax, raven companions alight on the rooftops and window ledges of palaces and keeps to eavesdrop on tyrants and dictators, feeding these precious secrets to the raven master so that she can more efficiently foment and organize rebellion.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>

Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Avian Empathy (Ex): </b>A raven master&#146;s wild empathy affects only birds.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Argent Magic: </b>A raven master casts spells as do most rangers, but her spell list is somewhat expanded from the normal options most rangers can choose from, for her association with the bards and other talented performers among the Silver Ravens allows her to add a limited number of bard spells to her spell list. These spells function as divine spells, and are cast and prepared in the same manner as her other ranger spells.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, the raven master selects one 1st-level bard spell of her choice and adds it to her spell list as a 1st-level ranger spell. At 9th level she does the same but for a 2ndlevel bard spell. She adds a 3rd-level bard spell at 12th level, and adds a 4th-level bard spell at 15th level.</p>
			<p>This ability alters the ranger&#146;s spellcasting.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Raven Companion (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a raven master earns the trust and companionship of a particularly large, powerful, and intelligent raven. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability, except that the raven master&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her ranger level &#150; 3. The raven master must select a bird as her animal companion. The raven companion starts with an Intelligence score of 3 and can speak one language known by the raven master. In addition to the normal abilities an animal companion gains as the raven master increases in level, the raven companion gains the following abilities.</p>
			<p>This ability alters hunter&#146;s bond and replaces specific ranger abilities as indicated below.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Silver Champion (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the raven companion takes on a silvery, metallic appearance. It treats all of its natural attacks as though they were magic and silver for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Mimic Figurine (Su): </b>At 8th level, once per day as a standard action, the raven master can transform her raven companion into a token similar to a figurine of wondrous power. Any gear worn by the raven melds into its body as part of this transformation, but held items do not. The raven can remain in this form indefinitely, or until the raven master spends a standard action to activate the statuette as though it were a figurine of wondrous power.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Cheat Death (Sp) </b>At 12th level, once per week, when a raven companion would otherwise be slain by an attack, spell, or effect, it can turn into a figurine of wondrous power as per its mimic figurine ability as an immediate action. Once transformed this way, the raven companion cannot transform back into a raven until the raven master next prepares spells.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces camouflage.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>A poison darter can concoct potent toxins that he can apply to his weapons. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his ranger level + his Wisdom modifier; if he has the toxic skin alternate racial trait (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide 190), he can expend a daily use of that poison to employ his debilitating venom ability an additional time. The debilitating venom functions only for the poison darter and becomes inert if not used within 1 hour. Creating a debilitating venom is a standard action, and it can be applied to a weapon as a move action.</p>
					<p>Debilitating Venom&#151;injury; save Fortitude DC = 10 + 1/2 the poison darter&#146;s level + his Wisdom modifier; frequency 1/ round for 4 rounds; effect 1d3 Dexterity damage; cure 1 save.</p>
					<p>At 5th level, the frequency increases to 6 rounds, and the toxin sickens a creature for 1 round every time it fails its saving throw to resist the poison. At 10th level, the poison&#146;s Dexterity damage increases to 1d4, and two successful saving throws are needed to cure the poison. At 15th level, the poison dart can choose to deal Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution damage with the debilitating venom, selected when he creates the toxin. At 20th level, the poison&#146;s damage die increases to 1d6.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>In dense jungles, foliage and tight spaces hinder all but the most deceptively humble weapons: blowguns and poison.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Venom (Ex): </b>A poison darter can concoct potent toxins that he can apply to his weapons. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his ranger level + his Wisdom modifier; if he has the toxic skin alternate racial trait (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide 190), he can expend a daily use of that poison to employ his debilitating venom ability an additional time. The debilitating venom functions only for the poison darter and becomes inert if not used within 1 hour. Creating a debilitating venom is a standard action, and it can be applied to a weapon as a move action.</p>
			<p>Debilitating Venom&#151;injury; save Fortitude DC = 10 + 1/2 the poison darter&#146;s level + his Wisdom modifier; frequency 1/ round for 4 rounds; effect 1d3 Dexterity damage; cure 1 save.</p>
			<p>At 5th level, the frequency increases to 6 rounds, and the toxin sickens a creature for 1 round every time it fails its saving throw to resist the poison. At 10th level, the poison&#146;s Dexterity damage increases to 1d4, and two successful saving throws are needed to cure the poison. At 15th level, the poison dart can choose to deal Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution damage with the debilitating venom, selected when he creates the toxin. At 20th level, the poison&#146;s damage die increases to 1d6.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces favored enemy and master hunter.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Use (Ex): </b>A poison darter is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Style (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, in place of a combat style feat, a poison darter can select any rogue talent that modifies sneak attacks or any alchemist discovery that modifies poisons he creates and applies, using his Wisdom modifier in place of his Intelligence modifier and his ranger level in place of his alchemist or rogue level for the purpose of meeting prerequisites. He can use the sticky poisonAPG discovery to apply a single dose of poison to two blowgun darts without reducing its potency.</p>
			<p>This ability modifies combat style feat.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Precise Dart (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a poison darter gains a sneak attack identical to the rogue class feature, but only when attacking with a blowgun. This deals 1d6 extra points of damage, and the damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level and every 2 ranger levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

The planar scout becomes infused with the essence of his plane of choice, taking on physical characteristics of denizens native to his chosen plane as well as the abilities listed below.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Aligned Plane: If the planar scout selects a plane with an alignment trait, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against outsiders and creatures with the extraplanar subtype whose alignments oppose this alignment trait. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
					<p>Astral Plane: Each day, the planar scout can teleport up to 5 feet per ranger level as a move action. This must be used in 5-foot increments. At 10th level, he can do so as a swift action.</p>
					<p>Ethereal Plane: The planar scout can damage incorporeal creatures with mundane weapons as if they were ghost touch weapons, and at 10th level, he can inflict critical hits and deal precision damage to incorporeal creatures.</p>
					<p>First World: As a swift action a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier, a planar scout can gain fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to his ranger level.</p>
					<p>Plane of Air: As a swift action, the planar scout can gain a fly speed (average) equal to his base speed for a number of minutes equal to his ranger level (minimum 1 minute). This duration need not be used consecutively.</p>
					<p>Plane of Earth: The planar scout gains a +1 bonus to his natural armor. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels he gains beyond 4th level.</p>
					<p>Plane of Fire: As a swift action, the planar scout can wreathe his body in flames. This grants the planar scout fire resistance 5 and causes his melee attacks to each deal 1d4 additional points of fire damage. The scout&#146;s fire resistance increases to 10 at 9th level, and 15 at 14th level. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his level. These rounds need not be used consecutively.</p>
					<p>Plane of Shadow: The planar scout gains darkvision 60 feet and a +4 bonus on Stealth checks. The bonus on Stealth checks increases by 2 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Planar scouts are rangers specializing in traversing the planes&#151;and surviving their journeys.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Planar Empathy (Ex): </b>A planar scout can use wild empathy only on animals with the extraplanar subtype. He can use this ability to influence outsiders with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p>This alters wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Planar Terrains (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a planar scout gains a planar terrain (see the sidebar on page 9). Planar terrains function in all ways like a ranger&#146;s favored terrain; he must select a new plane each time he gains a favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Bond (Su): </b>At 4th level, rather than forge a bond with an animal or his allies, a planar scout forms a bond with a specific plane. The planar scout becomes infused with the essence of his plane of choice, taking on physical characteristics of denizens native to his chosen plane as well as the abilities listed below.</p>
			<p>Aligned Plane: If the planar scout selects a plane with an alignment trait, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against outsiders and creatures with the extraplanar subtype whose alignments oppose this alignment trait. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>Astral Plane: Each day, the planar scout can teleport up to 5 feet per ranger level as a move action. This must be used in 5-foot increments. At 10th level, he can do so as a swift action.</p>
			<p>Ethereal Plane: The planar scout can damage incorporeal creatures with mundane weapons as if they were ghost touch weapons, and at 10th level, he can inflict critical hits and deal precision damage to incorporeal creatures.</p>
			<p>First World: As a swift action a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier, a planar scout can gain fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to his ranger level.</p>
			<p>Plane of Air: As a swift action, the planar scout can gain a fly speed (average) equal to his base speed for a number of minutes equal to his ranger level (minimum 1 minute). This duration need not be used consecutively.</p>
			<p>Plane of Earth: The planar scout gains a +1 bonus to his natural armor. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels he gains beyond 4th level.</p>
			<p>Plane of Fire: As a swift action, the planar scout can wreathe his body in flames. This grants the planar scout fire resistance 5 and causes his melee attacks to each deal 1d4 additional points of fire damage. The scout&#146;s fire resistance increases to 10 at 9th level, and 15 at 14th level. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his level. These rounds need not be used consecutively.</p>
			<p>Plane of Shadow: The planar scout gains darkvision 60 feet and a +4 bonus on Stealth checks. The bonus on Stealth checks increases by 2 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>Plane of Water: The planar scout gains the amphibious subtype and a swim speed equal to base speed.</p>
			<p>This replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Adaptation (Su): </b>At 9th level a planar scout gains planar adaptation when on his bonded plane. At 16th level he confers this protection to all allies within a 30-foot spread.</p>
			<p>This replaces evasion and improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>
			<h>Planar Terrains</h>
			<p>A staggering array of terrains await exploration in the Great Beyond. Some are akin to the forests, mountains, oceans, and plains of Material Plane worlds, but others are unlike anything found there, such as the ghostly reaches of the Ethereal Plane, the living and horrific reaches of the deep Abyss, the constantly burning inferno of the Plane of Fire, and the life-draining nothingness of the Negative Energy Plane.</p>
			<p>Some classes, like the ranger, interact directly with terrain, and class abilities like favored terrain can become complicated in a plane-hopping campaign. In games that are largely limited to the Material Plane, the planes terrain category works fine, but if you intend to run a game set on another plane, you should consider breaking up that category into specific planes (thus, a ranger would choose Heaven or Ethereal Plane, or even a demiplane like Leng as a favored terrain), or simply doing away with the planes category entirely. With this latter solution, you should work with ranger players to help them anticipate the terrains featured in your upcoming campaign, with new categories like crystalline (for realms in the Plane of Earth or under Elysium, where immense crystal formations are common), living (for truly sentient realms like portions of the Abyss), or void (for empty reaches in the Astral Plane or the energy planes) potentially becoming new options for rangers to select from.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The forested country of Nirmathas is known for its rangers&#151;skilled trackers, marksmen, and silent stalkers under the leafy canopy. Nirmathas has no formal military, for her people love their freedom and are reluctant to take orders from anyone, so her defense falls to individual scouts and small groups of allied commandos. Many of Nirmathas&#146;s rangers take the guide or skirmisher archetypes (see the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide), but some focus on the magic of stealth. These irregular troops fight against the frequent invasions by Molthuni soldiers, striking quickly and melting into the green shadows as soon as their opponents rally themselves for a counterattack. A Nirmathi irregular has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A Nirmathi irregular is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor. This replaces the normal ranger armor and weapon proficiency.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>At 4th level, a Nirmathi irregular increases his number of spells per day by +1 for every spell level. This means the irregular gets at least 1 spell per day as soon as he gains access to a level of spells, even if Table 3&#150;12: Ranger in the Core Rulebook lists 0 for spells per day.</p>
			<p>A Nirmathi irregular also learns to draw upon druidic magic, perhaps from association with the druids of Crystalhurst or a natural connection to the magic of the Fangwood. Each day when the ranger prepares spells, he may choose one druid spell and prepare it as if it were on the ranger spell list as a ranger spell of its druid spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
					<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Lantern lighters were originally entrusted with secretly eliminating the drow and quarantining any knowledge of their existence, but in the new Lantern Bearer era, the lantern lighters have refocused their efforts on helping to rescue those imprisoned by the drow, or even to help individual drow who seek to escape the cruelties of their society for a chance at redemption on the surface. Of course, escape from drow society is only the beginning of a drow&#146;s long and fraught path to redemption, and even the kindest or most repentant drow are likely to face prejudice from most of those who recognize her origins. In addition to their rescue efforts, lantern lighters often serve as sponsors for escapees and work to create pockets of civilization where redeemed drow can live in relative peace and safety by encouraging surface dwellers to cast aside the lurking shadows of prejudice and fear.</i></p>
			<p><i>While the vast majority of lantern lighters are elves from Kyonin, a few non-elven members of the organization have proven themselves trustworthy and dedicated enough to join their ranks. As their efforts to spread the light to other regions beyond Kyonin grow, lantern lighters of other races are beginning to round out the order&#146;s numbers, particularly in areas and regions that suffer under oppressive regimes.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Daylight: </b>A lantern lighter treats daylight as a 3rd-level ranger spell.</p>
			<p><b>Enhanced Vision (Ex): </b>A lantern lighter hones his senses to better combat subterranean enemies. He gains low-light vision. If the lantern lighter already has low-light vision, he can instead see three times as far as humans in areas of dim light.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a lantern lighter selects a favored terrain as normal. The skill bonus and initiative bonus granted in this favored terrain increase by 2 at 8th level and every 5 ranger levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>This ability alters favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a lantern lighter gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against poison.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces endurance.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Cavern Stride (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a lantern lighter&#146;s movement is unimpeded by nonmagical difficult terrain underground and nonmagical webs.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Darkvision (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a lantern lighter&#146;s senses fully attune to the darkness, granting him darkvision to a distance of 60 feet. If the lantern lighter already has darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.</p>
			<p>This replaces the favored terrain gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Immunity (Ex): </b>At 12th level, a lantern lighter gains immunity to poison.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces camouflage.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Light (Su): </b>At 13th level, a lantern lighter learns to increase the effectiveness of bright light on creatures with light blindness. Daylight spells cast by the lantern lighter or other sources of bright light he wields cause creatures with light blindness within the area of bright light to become stunned for 1 round in addition to being blinded.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the favored terrain gained at 13th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a lantern lighter gains camouflage, as the ranger class feature.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces hide in plain sight.</p>
			<p><b>Paralyzing Light (Su): </b>At 18th level, a lantern lighter can stop light-blind enemies in their tracks, often gaining a great edge in battle. Daylight spells cast by the lantern lighter or sources of bright light wielded by him cause creatures with light blindness within the area of bright light to become paralyzed for 1 round in addition to being blinded and stunned.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the favored terrain gained at 18th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

A jungle lord can choose his companion from the following list: ape, axe beakB3, baboonB2, bear, big cat (lion, tiger), bird, boar, crocodile (alligator), dinosaur (deinonychus, pteranodon B1, velociraptor), dog, elephantB1, giant chameleonB3, giant geckoB3, giant vultureB3, giraffeB4, hippopotamusB2, moaB5, monitor lizardB1, rhinocerosB1, small cat (cheetah, leopard), snake (constrictor, viper), or wolf.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Whether raised from birth under the jungle canopy in a native tribe or settlement, marooned as a child and reared by animals, or simply an ordinary person lost in the trackless tangle and forced to thrive in the wilderness or die, jungle lords are tempered by their harsh and unforgiving environments into something more than ordinary men and women. Their ordeals and experiences combine the physical prowess gained as a result of life hunting dangerous beasts with the wisdom gained from surviving countless natural dangers to earn them the respect of the jungle&#146;s denizens, man and animal alike.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A jungle lord is pro?cient with the dagger, battleaxe, blowgun, bolas, club, greatclub, handaxe, kukri, lasso (Path?nder RPG Ultimate Equipment 31), longbow, longspear, net, quarterstaff, shortbow, shortspear, sling, spear, and whip. Jungle Lords are not pro?cient with armor and shields.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Focus (Su): </b>As a swift action, a jungle lord can take on the aspect of an animal, gaining a bonus or a special ability based on the type of animal emulated. This ability functions as the hunter&#146;s animal focus class feature (Path?nder RPG Advanced Class Guide 27), though it applies only to the jungle lord and not an animal companion. The jungle lord can use this ability for 1 minute per day per ranger level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. He can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces favored enemy.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Language: </b>A jungle lord's language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a jungle lord must select jungle as his ?rst favored terrain. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p><b>Hardened by Nature (Ex): </b>At 4th level, the jungle lord's keen senses make him harder to hit and more able to withstand those blows that manage to sneak by his defenses. When unarmored and unencumbered, the jungle lord can add his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and his CMB. In addition, the jungle lord gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC at 6th level, and every 3 ranger levels thereafter (9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th). He loses these bonuses when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces spells.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>Hunter&#146;s Bond (Ex): A jungle lord forms a close bond with an animal companion. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the jungle lord&#146;s effective druid level is equal to his ranger level -3. The jungle lord gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks regarding his animal companion. A jungle lord can choose his companion from the following list: ape, axe beakB3, baboonB2, bear, big cat (lion, tiger), bird, boar, crocodile (alligator), dinosaur (deinonychus, pteranodon B1, velociraptor), dog, elephantB1, giant chameleonB3, giant geckoB3, giant vultureB3, giraffeB4, hippopotamusB2, moaB5, monitor lizardB1, rhinocerosB1, small cat (cheetah, leopard), snake (constrictor, viper), or wolf. (Superscript B indicates a Path?nder RPG Bestiary volume.)</p>
			<p>The jungle lord can have up to four animal companions, but he must divide up his e?ective druid level between his companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a jungle lord with an effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion, two and- level companions, or one lst-level and one 3rd-level companion. Each time a jungle lord&#146;s effective druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in thejungle lord&#146;s service (he must release a companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion).</p>
			<p>This alters hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Brachiation (Ex): </b>At 5th level, as a free action for a number of rounds per day equal to his ranger level, a jungle lord can climb with a climb speed equal to his land speed, and gains a bonus on Acrobatics checks equal to his ranger level. These rounds do not have to be consecutive.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the additional favored terrain granted to rangers at 5th level. The jungle lord still gains additional favored terrains at 10th, 15th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Inspired Moment (Ex): </b>At 11th level, the jungle lord can have an inspired moment once per day as a free action. The jungle lord gains the following bene?ts until the end of his next turn. His speed increases by 10 feet. He can take an extra move or swift action on his turn. He gains a +4 bonus to AC and on attack rolls, skill checks, or ability checks. Finally, he automatically con?rms any critical threat he scores. He can use this ability one additional time per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces quarry and improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Strong Bond (Ex): </b>At 12th level, the jungle lord strengthens his bond with his animal companions. The jungle lord&#146;s effective druid level for his animal companions is now equal to his ranger level; he can immediately allocate these additional levels to his companions as he sees ?t.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces camou?age.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Victory Cry (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the jungle lord&#146;s signature battle cry rallies his animal friends to greater combat prowess and hardiness. The jungle lord can shout his victory cry a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modi?er as a standard action. Each time he does so, his animal companions within 200 feet gain a +6 morale bonus on attack rolls and to AC, and all threatened critical hits made by his animal companions are automatically con?rmed. Furthermore, following his victory cry, the jungle lord can apply a number of animal aspects equal to his Wisdom modi?er when using animal focus, rather than the usual limit of one. These effects last for 1 minute.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces master hunter.</p>

He chooses one type of creature he has selected as a favored enemy, such as &#147;aberrations.&#148; The ranger selects one ability or feat from the adaptation list for that type (see below). A ranger can use adaptations for 10 minutes per day per ranger level he possesses. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 10-minute increments. If the adaptation requires the ranger to make a more specific choice (such as what skill to use with Skill Focus), this choice is permanent and cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>At 8th, 13th, and 15th-level, the ranger chooses another one of his favored enemy types and selects one adaptation from that type&#146;s list, as well as an additional adaptation from any one list of a creature type he&#146;s selected (including the one just chosen, if so desired). The infiltrator can only use one adaptation at a time. This class ability replaces favored terrain.</p>

				<name type="string">Hunter's Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some rangers study their favored enemies and learn their ways, applying this knowledge to their own abilities and using their foes&#146; strengths against them. Infiltrators are willing to walk a mile in an enemy&#146;s shoes so as to learn eveything there is to know about their foes in order to more effectively hunt and kill them.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Adaptation (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an infiltrator learns how to copy the unusual abilities of his prey. He chooses one type of creature he has selected as a favored enemy, such as &#147;aberrations.&#148; The ranger selects one ability or feat from the adaptation list for that type (see below). A ranger can use adaptations for 10 minutes per day per ranger level he possesses. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 10-minute increments. If the adaptation requires the ranger to make a more specific choice (such as what skill to use with Skill Focus), this choice is permanent and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 8th, 13th, and 15th-level, the ranger chooses another one of his favored enemy types and selects one adaptation from that type&#146;s list, as well as an additional adaptation from any one list of a creature type he&#146;s selected (including the one just chosen, if so desired). The infiltrator can only use one adaptation at a time. This class ability replaces favored terrain.</p>
			<p><i>Aberration: </i>amphibious, darkvision 60 ft., Iron Will, natural armor +2.</p>

			<p><i>Vermin: </i>climb 15 ft., darkvision 60 ft., Great Fortitude, Iron Will, swim 15 ft.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Ilsurian archers maintain the strong tradition of archery first developed by soldiers in the service of Ilsur, who raised a small army with which he intended to overthrow the monarch of Korvosa after the fall of the Chelish Empire. Though Ilsur&#146;s Arena teaches only the basics of these techniques, a few dedicated students strive toward true mastery in each generation.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bullseye Shot (Ex): </b>At 1st level, an Ilsurian archer gains the Bullseye ShotISG feat as a bonus feat. He need not meet its prerequisites. This ability replaces track and wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>

			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table.

					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Rangers of the plains use horses or other riding beasts to hunt their lands, forging a near-mystical relationship with their mounts. Horse lords are unparalleled mounted combatants, the envy of even the most dedicated cavalier. Though called &#147;horse lords&#148; as a generic term, these rangers are not restricted to horses for their animal companions&#151;any creature the ranger can ride is included in these abilities. A horse lord has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a horse lord must choose the mounted combat style. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Mounted Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, the horse lord forms a bond with an animal he can use as a mount, which becomes his animal companion. A Medium ranger can select a camel or a horse. A small ranger can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or dog if he is at least 7th level. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger&#146;s effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Handle Animal and Ride checks with his animal companion mount. This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Strong Bond (Ex): </b>At 12th level, the horse lord strengthens his bond with his mount. The ranger&#146;s effective druid level for his mount is now equal to his ranger level. This ability replaces camouflage.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Spiritual Bond (Su): </b>At 17th level, the horse lord can grant his animal companion temporary hit points equal to his ranger level once per day. While these temporary hit points last, when his mount is within 30 feet of the him, he can choose to share the damage taken by his mount as if using shield other. This ability replaces hide in plain sight.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

				<name type="string">Panache</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, the hooded champion gains the swashbuckler&#146;s panache class feature. He regains panache through critical hits and killing blows when using a bow of any kind, rather than when using a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon. If the hooded champion has this ability and the panache ability from another class or archetype, the panache points from the two sources do not stack, but the hooded champion regains panache in any way either class feature allows him to. For example, a character with a Charisma score of 16 who has both the hooded champion&#146;s and the swashbuckler&#146;s panache has a base of 3 panache points, and regains panache from critical hits and killing blows from both bows and light or one-handed piercing melee weapons.

					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The hooded champion lives on the periphery of civilized lands, and is often at odds with the forces of law and order. He is frequently a hero of oppressed peoples, lurking in the woods near their homes and trying to right the injustices inflicted upon them by the wealthy and powerful.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>At 1st level, the hooded champion gains the swashbuckler&#146;s derring-do and dodging panache deeds, as well as the following deeds. For all deeds, treat the hooded champion&#146;s ranger level as his swashbuckler level.</p>
			<p><i>Dead Aim (Ex): </i>At 1st level, the hooded champion&#146;s can spend 1 panache point when making a single ranged attack (not a full attack) with a bow to make a ranged touch attack instead. The target must be in the bow&#146;s first range increment.</p>
			<p>At 3rd level, the hooded champion gains the swashbuckler&#146;s kip-up deed as well as the following deed.</p>
			<p><i>Hooded Champion&#146;s Initiative (Ex): </i>At 3rd level, while the hooded champion has at least 1 panache point, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. In addition, if he has the Quick Draw feat, his hands are free and unrestrained, and his weapon isn&#146;t hidden, he can draw a single bow as part of the initiative check.</p>
			<p><b>Panache (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the hooded champion gains the swashbuckler&#146;s panache class feature. He regains panache through critical hits and killing blows when using a bow of any kind, rather than when using a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon. If the hooded champion has this ability and the panache ability from another class or archetype, the panache points from the two sources do not stack, but the hooded champion regains panache in any way either class feature allows him to. For example, a character with a Charisma score of 16 who has both the hooded champion&#146;s and the swashbuckler&#146;s panache has a base of 3 panache points, and regains panache from critical hits and killing blows from both bows and light or one-handed piercing melee weapons. This ability replaces favored enemy at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the hooded champion must select the archery combat style. At 9th level, the hooded champion gains the swashbuckler&#146;s grace and evasive deeds. At 16th level, the hooded champion gains the swashbuckler&#146;s edge and cheat death deeds. This ability replaces wild empathy, endurance, evasion, and improved evasion.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some rangers aren&#146;t the type to put their steel and sweat behind fighting particular kinds of creatures. Instead, these shrewd warriors alter their focus and dedicate their efforts to dismantling enemy organizations. Guildbreakers stoke their enmity for their foes, and they train to track the movements of rival organizations, and even to infiltrate these groups to gather secret intelligence.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Bluff (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Organization (Ex): </b>When a guildbreaker selects a favored enemy, he can opt to select a specific organization, such as a particular thieves&#146; guild, in lieu of a specific creature type. The guildbreaker must select this option for his first favored enemy, but he can choose either option for his later favored enemies. The guildbreaker&#146;s bonuses from favored enemy apply against official members of this organization regardless of their creature type, but not against the organization&#146;s allies, paid mercenaries, or forced labor. This ability only applies if the guildbreaker knows that the target is a member of the organization.</p>
			<p>This ability alters favored enemy.</p>
			<p><b>Read the City (Ex): </b>A guildbreaker spends most of his time in cities and large population centers. As a result, he gains an innate sense of comings and goings in the hustle around him. When in an urban environment, a guildbreaker can use the Survival skill to gather information, but only about the movements of creatures and what sort of people (races, social classes, predominant professions, and the like) occupy the community. Unlike with the normal way to gather information, the guildbreaker studies the signs of the city instead of asking around, so it doesn&#146;t spread word about the nature of his questions to others.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Deep Cover (Ex, Su): </b>Guildbreakers may work to dismantle their enemies&#146; power structures from within, and they know how to gather resources and the necessary trappings in order to masquerade as a member of those organizations. At 4th level, a guildbreaker adds a circumstance bonus equal to twice his favored organization bonus to all Bluff and Disguise checks to appear to be a member of the organization (this does not apply on Disguise checks to change his appearance and replace a specific member, but rather to checks related to appear to be a general member of the organization).</p>
			<p>The bonus on Bluff checks from deep cover stacks with the guildbreaker&#146;s overall bonus from favored organization if the person he is attempting to deceive is also a member of that organization.</p>
			<p>A guildbreaker posing as a member of one of his favored enemy organizations automatically defeats truth-telling magic (as if under the effects of glibness), but only for the purpose of claiming to be a member of the organization. Truth-telling magic can still expose him with a more indirect question, such as a member of a non-religious evil organization asking the guildbreaker for the identity of his patron deity.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>

When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Crowd Stride (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a guildbreaker can slip through crowded streets with ease. His movement speed is not reduced when moving through a crowd.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Many rangers are loners, but some choose to use their familiarity with the land to guide others safely through the wilderness. The guide forgoes a favored enemy to focus on the task or foe at hand, and can pass his knowledge and luck on to his charges. A guide has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Ranger&#146;s Focus (Ex): </b>At 1st level, once per day, the guide can focus on a single enemy within line of sight as a swift action. That creature remains the ranger&#146;s focus until it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points or surrenders, or until the ranger designates a new focus, whichever occurs first. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against the target of his focus. At 5th level, and every five levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the ranger can use this ability one additional time per day. This ability replaces favored enemy.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Terrain Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, the guide forms a bond with the land itself, enabling him to direct others in such terrain. When in his favored terrain, the ranger grants all allies within line of sight and that can hear him a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. Also, as long as they travel with him, the ranger&#146;s allies leave no trail and can&#146;t be tracked. The ranger can choose for the group to leave a trail, or even specific members of the group to leave a trail if he so desires. This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Ranger&#146;s Luck (Ex): </b>Upon reaching 9th level, once per day the guide can either reroll one of his attack rolls or force an enemy who just hit him with an attack to reroll the attack roll. The ranger must take the result of the second roll even if it is worse. A ranger can use this ability once per day at 9th level, plus one additional time per day at 14th and 19th levels. This ability replaces evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Inspired Moment (Ex): </b>At 11th level, the guide can have an inspired moment once per day as a free action. The ranger gains the following benefits until the end of his next turn. His speed increases by 10 feet. He can take an extra move or swift action on his turn. He gains a +4 bonus to AC and on attack rolls, skill checks, or ability checks. Finally, he automatically confirms any critical threat he scores. He can use this ability one additional time per day at 19th level. This ability replaces quarry and improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Ranger&#146;s Luck (Ex): </b>Upon reaching 16th level, the ranger&#146;s luck increases. He gains a +4 bonus on his rerolls made with the ranger&#146;s luck ability, or if he forces an enemy to reroll an attack, that enemy takes a &#150;4 penalty on the roll. This bonus or penalty is also applied on any roll to confirm critical hits. This ability replaces improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The groom attends to the needs of the party&#146;s mounts and beasts of burden during their adventures, and guards these animals while the party goes underground.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hide the Horses (Ex): </b>A groom finds the best place to stable and conceal a party&#146;s mounts while the group explores a dungeon. A groom adds half her level (minimum 1) on Stealth skill checks for both herself and the mounts she&#146;s hiding while she is concealing a party&#146;s mounts. This ability replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Horse Whisperer (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a groom can use speak with animals at will, but can use this power only on horses, riding dogs, and other mounts of the animal type. This ability replaces Endurance.</p>
			<p><b>Scout the Area (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a groom gains a +4 bonus on Knowledge (local) checks. In addition, she always knows where to find the nearest expert or spellcaster who can provide a particular service, such as the nearest source of raise dead. This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s 1st favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses). At 13th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

If the attack hits, it deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage and the ranger can make an additional attack at his full base attack bonus against a foe that is adjacent to the previous foe and still within his reach, as if he had Cleave, except he doesn&#146;t take a &#150;2 penalty to his AC and the second attack deals an additional 2d6 points of electricity damage. At 12th level, the ranger can continue to make attacks against adjacent creatures, as if he had Greater Cleave, with each hit increasing the amount of electricity damage dealt to the next foe in line.

				<name type="string">Hunter's Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

				<name type="string">Spells</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

				<name type="string">Technological Trapsmith</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 7th level, a galvanic saboteur can rig technological traps using the remains of destroyed constructs with the clockwork or robot subtype. To successfully rig such a trap, the ranger must spend 1 minute working on the destroyed construct and succeed at a Disable Device check (DC = 10 + the construct&#146;s HD). On a failure, the trap doesn&#146;t function and the construct&#146;s remains are ruined. On a success, the ranger creates a mechanical trap with the following statistics.</p>
					<p>Rigged Construct Trap</p>
					<p>Type mechanical; Perception DC 20; Disable Device DC 20</p>
					<p>Effects</p>
					<p>Trigger location (all spaces occupied by the construct&#146;s remains); Reset none</p>
					<p>Effect blast of electricity (1d6 electricity damage/2 HD of construct); Reflex negates (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ranger&#146;s level + his Intelligence modifier); multiple targets (all targets within 5 ft. of construct&#146;s remains)</p>
					<p>Other types of destroyed constructs can serve as suitable materials for a rigged construct trap (at the GM&#146;s discretion). Constructs destroyed by disintegrate or similar effects that leave no intact remains cannot be used to create a rigged construct trap. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>

In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The transformation of the great warlord Kevoth-Kul into the hedonistic Black Sovereign a few decades ago was difficult for the people of Numeria to accept. Many Kellid locals blame Kevoth-Kul&#146;s change on the influence of the Technic League and view both the League and their mechanical minions with a mix of fear and distrust. Some Kellid rangers have since developed skills to defeat the League&#146;s robotic enforcers and devious arcanists.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disable Device (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a galvanic saboteur must select construct creatures as his first favored enemy. This ability alters favored enemy. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Reprogram (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a galvanic saboteur can improve the initial attitude of a mindless construct. This ability functions as wild empathy, except only against mindless constructs. The ranger can use this ability against constructs with an Intelligence score, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check. This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Lucky Dodge (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a galvanic saboteur can dodge the precise attacks of even the most technologically advanced foes. The ranger gains a luck bonus to AC against attacks that target his touch AC as long as his opponent&#146;s type matches that of his first favored enemy. This luck bonus is equal to 1/2 the ranger&#146;s favored enemy bonus against that creature type. At 8th, 13th, and 18th levels, the ranger gains this luck bonus to AC against attacks that target touch his AC as long as his opponent&#146;s type matches his second, third, and fourth favored enemy, respectively. A galvanic saboteur&#146;s animal companion (if he chose one for his hunter&#146;s bond) also gains this luck bonus. This ability replaces favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Technological Trapsmith (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a galvanic saboteur can rig technological traps using the remains of destroyed constructs with the clockwork or robot subtype. To successfully rig such a trap, the ranger must spend 1 minute working on the destroyed construct and succeed at a Disable Device check (DC = 10 + the construct&#146;s HD). On a failure, the trap doesn&#146;t function and the construct&#146;s remains are ruined. On a success, the ranger creates a mechanical trap with the following statistics.</p>
			<p><b>Rigged Construct Trap</b></p>
			<p><b>Type </b>mechanical; <b>Perception </b>DC 20; <b>Disable Device </b>DC 20</p>
			<p><b>Effects</b></p>
			<p><b>Trigger </b>location (all spaces occupied by the construct&#146;s remains); <b>Reset </b>none</p>
			<p><b>Effect </b>blast of electricity (1d6 electricity damage/2 HD of construct); Reflex negates (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ranger&#146;s level + his Intelligence modifier); multiple targets (all targets within 5 ft. of construct&#146;s remains)</p>
			<p>Other types of destroyed constructs can serve as suitable materials for a rigged construct trap (at the GM&#146;s discretion). Constructs destroyed by disintegrate or similar effects that leave no intact remains cannot be used to create a rigged construct trap. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Static Strike (Ex): </b>At 8th level, the galvanic saboteur has gathered enough parts and scrap from his constructed enemies that he can infuse some of his attacks with a bit of their alien energy. Once per day as a standard action, the ranger can make a static strike as a melee attack at his full base attack bonus. If the attack hits, it deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage and the ranger can make an additional attack at his full base attack bonus against a foe that is adjacent to the previous foe and still within his reach, as if he had Cleave, except he doesn&#146;t take a &#150;2 penalty to his AC and the second attack deals an additional 2d6 points of electricity damage. At 12th level, the ranger can continue to make attacks against adjacent creatures, as if he had Greater Cleave, with each hit increasing the amount of electricity damage dealt to the next foe in line. The ranger can use this ability twice per day at 14th level and three times per day at 20th level. This ability replaces swift tracker and camouflage.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Sensor Evasion (Su): </b>At 17th level, a galvanic saboteur has mastered the art of evading technological and magical observation. He can use the Stealth skill against constructs and magical sensors (such as those created by arcane eye or clairaudience/clairvoyance) even while being observed. This ability replaces hide in plain sight.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A freebooter is a natural leader, a pirate who works well with a variety of people and in a variety of roles. Her specialized combat tactics help organize and direct a crew, and freebooters&#146; talents are in high demand. Most freebooters work as independent agents. A freebooter signs on with a crew when she feels the urge to travel, and often moves to a new ship when her contract ends.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Freebooter's Bane (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the freebooter can, as a move action, indicate an enemy in combat and rally her allies to focus on that target. The freebooter and her allies gain a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against the target. This ability applies only to allies who can see or hear the freebooter and who are within 30 feet of the freebooter at the time she activates this ability. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the bonus increases by 1.</p>
			<p>The freebooter&#146;s bane lasts until the target dies or the freebooter selects a new target. This ability replaces favored enemy.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Freebooter&#146;s Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a freebooter forms a bond with her crewmates. This bond allows her to spend a move action to grant her allies extra combat prowess when they work as a team. All allies within 30 feet who can see or hear the freebooter gain an additional +2 bonus on attack rolls when flanking with the freebooter or with another ally affected by this ability. This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Swimmer (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a freebooter may swim half her speed as a move action or her normal speed as a full-round action with a successful Swim check. The freebooter gains a +2 bonus on Swim checks. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills).

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Vanaras often leave home to seek fortune and sate their curiosity regarding the mysterious lands that lie beyond their native territories. The most skilled of these thrillseekers are called ba-sadhaks, or fortune-finders. So successful have these canny explorers been at exploring Golarion at large that the secrets of their success are closely guarded, resulting in only extremely rare nonvanaran fortune-finders.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hinterlander (Ex): </b>A fortune-finder adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) on all Climb and Swim checks.</p>
			<p>This replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Adaptable Study (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a fortune-finder can adapt and orient himself to new environments and new enemies. He gains a +1 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks whenever he is in a terrain he hasn&#146;t selected as one of his favored terrains. He leaves no trail and can&#146;t be tracked in any such terrain (though he can leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>In addition to this, the fortune-finder can study an opponent he can see as a move action. He then gains a bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, as well as on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The bonus is equal to half the fortune-finder&#146;s highest favored enemy bonus. A fortune-finder can&#146;t attempt Knowledge checks untrained to identify an opponent he has studied with adaptable study. Bonuses from adaptable study don&#146;t stack with those from the favored enemy ability. The ranger can study only a single target at a time.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Trailblazer (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a fortune-finder can move through any sort of difficult terrain at his normal speed. Terrain that is enchanted or magically manipulated to impede movement, however, still affects the fortune-finder.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Study (Ex): </b>Beginning at 11th level, a fortune-finder can study an opponent using adaptable study as a swift or move action. In addition to this, he can maintain bonuses from adaptable study against one additional opponent. At 19th level, he can study an opponent using adaptable study as an immediate, swift, or move action and can maintain the bonuses from adaptable study against a total of three opponents.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces quarry and improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Explorer (Ex): </b>A fortune-finder of 20th level becomes a master explorer. He can move through any sort of terrain that impedes movement at his full speed, even if it is enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion. As a full-round action, he can study one opponent he can see and has already studied with adaptable study, increasing the benefits he gains from that ability to equal his full favored enemy bonus.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces master hunter.</p>

					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

The flames don&#146;t harm the flamewarden&#146;s allies, who instead are healed 5d6 points of damage, and any poisons they are currently suffering are neutralized as per neutralize poison. The flamewarden&#146;s body is reduced to ashes by the explosion.</p>
					<p>At 20th level, the flamewarden gains immunity to fire, and once per week, the flamewarden rises from the ashes of his own destruction 1 round after dying. The flamewarden&#146;s body re-forms with all his equipment, and he returns to life with half his maximum hit points. Any ability scores that were 0 become 1, and nonmagical diseases and poisons are cured.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Emulating the blazing phoenix, flamewardens sweep through the world like a selective forest fire, burning away corruption, evil, and those who cling to decay.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Touch of Flame (Su): </b>At 4th level, a flamewarden can cause his weapons to burst into flame. As a standard action, the ranger can grant a single weapon he holds the flaming special ability for 1 minute; while under this effect, the weapon counts as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A flamewarden can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier. At 12th level, weapons affected by this ability gain the flaming burst special ability instead.</p>
			<p>This replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A flamewarden can prepare spells from the druid list that have the fire descriptor.</p>
			<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Stoking the Embers (Sp): </b>At 9th level, a flamewarden can fan the last spark of a recently slain creature&#146;s life force back into a full flame. Once per day as a standard action, a flamewarden can touch the corpse of a creature that has died within 1 round to grant it the effects of breath of life. This replaces evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Burning Renewal (Su): </b>At 12th level, a flamewarden can use the cleansing power of fire to remove afflictions from his body, mind, and soul. When the flamewarden takes 5 or more points of fire damage, he can remove one of the following conditions: fatigued, shaken, or sickened. Alternatively, he can remove 1 point of ability damage or drain from an ability score of his choice.</p>
			<p>If the flamewarden takes 10 or more points of fire damage, he can remove one of the following conditions: exhausted, frightened, or nauseated. Alternatively, he can remove 1d6 points of ability damage or drain from an ability score of his choice.</p>
			<p>The ranger can use this ability only once each time he takes fire damage, regardless of how much damage it deals over the required amount. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If the flamewarden has fire resistance or immunity to fire, fire damage he would have otherwise taken still counts toward activating burning renewal.</p>
			<p>This replaces camouflage.</p>
			<p><b>Phoenix Rising (Su): </b>At 16th level, if a flamewarden dies, his body explodes in a conflagration in a 20-foot spread. Each hostile creature in the area takes 10d6 points of fire damage unless it succeeds at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the ranger&#146;s level + his Constitution modifier) for half damage. The flames don&#146;t harm the flamewarden&#146;s allies, who instead are healed 5d6 points of damage, and any poisons they are currently suffering are neutralized as per neutralize poison. The flamewarden&#146;s body is reduced to ashes by the explosion.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, the flamewarden gains immunity to fire, and once per week, the flamewarden rises from the ashes of his own destruction 1 round after dying. The flamewarden&#146;s body re-forms with all his equipment, and he returns to life with half his maximum hit points. Any ability scores that were 0 become 1, and nonmagical diseases and poisons are cured. A limited wish, miracle, or wish spell cast before he rises from the ashes prevents him from doing so, as does the area of an unhallow effect.</p>
			<p>This replaces improved evasion and master hunter.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>

He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
					<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 6th level, when outdoors, a falconer can direct his feathered companion to strike an enemy from high above. His feathered companion gains the following trick as a bonus trick.</p>
					<p><i>Swooping Charge (DC 20; bird): </i>The falconer&#146;s bird companion flies up and then swoops down into a charge. To perform this trick, the companion must be able to fly, and it must be outdoors or someplace with enough room for the bird to fly great distances in (a grand cathedral may have enough room, but dungeons usually do not). It spends a full-round action flying to a high vantage point, and on the next round makes a charge attack upon an enemy the falconer designates. If that charge attack hits, the bird deals 2d4 points of damage instead of 1d4 with its bite and gains a &#215;4 critical modifier when making the attack. If the bird hits, the target is staggered for 1 round. This ability replaces the combat style feat the ranger gains at 6th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Rangers have always enjoyed a special bond with a specific animal, but the falconer takes this bond to a deeper level. Falconers begin with their companion earlier than other rangers, and have the ability to teach their companions special tricks.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Feathered Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a falconer earns the trust and companionship of a bird of prey. The bird can be of any type of large hunting or scavenging bird (even a vulture). This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature), but the falconer must take the bird (or falcon; Ultimate Wildneress pg. 178) animal companion, and that companion has only half the normal hit points.</p>
			<p>The falconer cannot teach the bird of prey the work trick, but can teach it either the roam or distract trick for free. Whichever trick the falconer does not pick then can be picked as a trick later.</p>
			<p><i>Roam (DC 15): </i>The falconer can let his animal companion loose to roam and forage. He must let it roam for no more than a week. When the falconer lets it roam, it agrees to return to the place he let it loose within the time period he designates.</p>
			<p><i>Distract (DC 20; bird only): </i>The animal companion flutters wildly around any enemy it would normally attack with the attack trick. It makes an attack roll against that enemy. On a hit, the enemy is shaken for 1 round. This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a falconer must select an animal companion when he gains hunter&#146;s bond. He does not gain a new companion at 4th level; rather, his feathered companion gains full hit points.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Swoop for the Kill (Ex): </b>At 6th level, when outdoors, a falconer can direct his feathered companion to strike an enemy from high above. His feathered companion gains the following trick as a bonus trick.</p>
			<p><i>Swooping Charge (DC 20; bird): </i>The falconer&#146;s bird companion flies up and then swoops down into a charge. To perform this trick, the companion must be able to fly, and it must be outdoors or someplace with enough room for the bird to fly great distances in (a grand cathedral may have enough room, but dungeons usually do not). It spends a full-round action flying to a high vantage point, and on the next round makes a charge attack upon an enemy the falconer designates. If that charge attack hits, the bird deals 2d4 points of damage instead of 1d4 with its bite and gains a &#215;4 critical modifier when making the attack. If the bird hits, the target is staggered for 1 round. This ability replaces the combat style feat the ranger gains at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
					<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>

				<name type="string">Hunter's Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An elemental envoy travels the Elemental Planes. He has learned to protect himself from their many dangers, and he models his fighting style after their teachings.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an elemental envoy must choose the elemental combat style on this page, choosing his combat style feats from that list.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Explorer (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, instead of selecting a favored terrain, an elemental envoy gains the typical favored terrain bonuses when traveling on the Plane of Air, Plane of Earth, Plane of Fire, and Plane of Water, except the elemental envoy gains a bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks instead of Knowledge (geography) checks. At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter, he does not select an additional favored terrain, but his favored terrain bonuses increase by 2.</p>
			<p>This alters favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Hunters and guides through the Shadow Plane, dusk stalkers are rangers that thrive in shadow. Adept at hunting in dusk, darkness, and twilight, these rangers excel at manipulating shadows.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Fetchling Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Shadow Guide: </b>When a dusk stalker gains the favored terrain ability, that ability is modified in the following ways. At 3rd level, a dusk stalker picks his primary terrain normally, but only gains a +1 bonus on those checks while on a plane other than the Shadow Plane, and gains a +3 bonus on those checks while on the Shadow Plane. Each time he chooses to add a bonus in a favored terrain, he gains a +1 bonus on those checks while on a plane other than the Shadow Plane, and gains a +3 bonus on those checks while on the Shadow Plane. This ability modifies favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Shadow Bond (Su): </b>At 4th level, a dusk stalker creates a mystical bond with shadows. The shadows around a dusk stalker weave and swirl, confusing his enemies. When a dusk stalker is fighting in dim light or darkness (magical or otherwise), he gains a +4 insight bonus on Acrobatics checks made to move through an enemy&#146;s threatened area or through its space. Furthermore, a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier, the dusk stalker can manipulate shadows in a 5-foot square within 30 feet. That square must be in an area of dim light or darkness (magical or otherwise). Enemies with an Intelligence score within or adjacent to that 5-foot square take a &#150;2 penalty to AC and on Reflex saving throws. The harassing shadows last for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Dark Sight (Su): </b>At 12th level, a dusk stalker gains the see in darkness ability. This ability replaces camouflage.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
					<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
					<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

				<name type="string">Hunter's Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>These rangers specialize in surviving hostile subterranean environs. They are well equipped to avoid traps, spot secret passages, and deal with inimical dungeon tenants.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disable Device (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Stone Scouting (Ex): </b>A dungeon rover gains a +2 bonus on Perception checks to notice underground environmental hazards, including traps, potential cave-ins, and dangerous flora. A dungeon rover receives a check to notice these hazards whenever he passes within 10 feet of them, whether or not he is actively looking. This ability replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Vermin Affinity (Ex): </b>A dungeon rover gains the ability to improve the attitude of mindless subterranean creatures. This ability functions as the wild empathy class feature, except a dungeon rover can influence any vermin (even those without Intelligence scores) instead of animals. Additionally, a dungeon rover can influence oozes with a &#150;4 penalty on his vermin affinity check. This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Dungeon Ally (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a dungeon rover may select a giant slug, a giant centipede, a goblin dog, a giant scorpion, or any poisonous snake as his animal companion, in addition to the usual animal companion options available to rangers with the hunter&#146;s bond class feature. This ability modifies hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Subterranean Stride (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a dungeon rover is never slowed by difficult terrain while underground. However, areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Stone Scouting (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a dungeon rover&#146;s bonus on Perception checks to notice underground environmental hazards increases to +4. Additionally, the rover receives a check to notice these irregularities whenever he passes within 15 feet of them. This ability replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some rangers specialize in dealing with rambunctious younger drakes, protecting them and teaching them to tolerate, and even trust, humanoid creatures. These drake wardens follow and pass along secret techniques for raising drakes effectively, and thanks to their methods, their drakes are both fiercely loyal and extremely useful for scouting and stealth missions.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Young Drake: </b>At 4th level, a drake warden gains a drake companion instead of an animal companion, but his effective charge&#146;s level is equal to his ranger level - 3. The young drake gains drake powers only when its charge reaches 3rd and 7th levels (not 11th or 15th level) and increases in size only when its charge reaches 5th level (not 9th, 13th, or 17th level).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond, 2nd favored enemy, and swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

					<p>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Predatory Deduction (Ex): </b>Beginning at 1st level, when a dragon hunter successfully uses Survival to spot the trail of a creature of the dragon type, the hunter may attempt an immediate DC 15 Knowledge (arcana) check. On a success, the dragon hunter is able to deduce the species, age category, size, and color of the dragon. If the trail is less than 48 hours old, the dragon hunter gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the Knowledge check. This ability replaces Track.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Wyrm Hatred (Ex): </b>Beginning at 1st level, a dragon hunter must select dragons as his favored enemy, granting him a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of the dragon type. He also gains +2 bonuses on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. These bonuses increase by +2 at 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Dragoncrafting (Ex): </b>Dragon hunters are experts not only at tracking and killing dragons, but also at using dragon bodies to craft unique equipment. A dragon hunter gains Dragoncrafting as a bonus feat at 5th level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. See page 18 of this book for more information. This ability replaces the additional favored enemy and any bonuses to existing favored enemies gained at 5th level.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Undaunted (Ex): </b>Beginning at 10th level, a dragon hunter gains a +4 bonus on Will saves made to resist mind-affecting fear effects, Reflex saves made to avoid damage from breath weapons, Reflex saves made to avoid crush attacks, and Reflex saves made to avoid damage from tail sweep attacks. This ability replaces the additional favored enemy and any bonuses to existing favored enemies gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Expert Dragoncrafter (Ex): </b>At 15th level, a dragon hunter may take 10 on Heal and Craft skill checks to harvest dragoncraft materials and to create dragoncraft items. Additionally, the amount of time required to create a dragoncraft item is reduced by half. This ability replaces the additional favored enemy and any bonuses to existing favored enemies gained at 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Resilience (Su): </b>At 20th level, a dragon hunter gains energy resistance 30 against a single energy type for 1 hour. The energy types he may choose are acid, cold, electricity, and fire. He may use this ability once per day. This ability replaces the additional favored enemy and any bonuses to existing favored enemies gained at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Blessed by his deity, a divine tracker hunts down those he deems deserving of his retribution. His weapon is likely to find purchase in his favored enemy.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>A divine tracker&#146;s alignment must be within one step of his deity&#146;s, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Favored Weapon: </b>At 1st level, a divine tracker becomes proficient with the favored weapon of his deity. If his deity&#146;s favored weapon is unarmed strike, he instead gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat.

He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>

In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
					<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some rangers devote their lives to the woods, becoming hunters, protectors, and wilderness guides among its diverse terrain types. The deep walker is instead a master of the strange terrain of the deep earth, exploring its caverns and caves, becoming a master of the dark corridors most surface dwellers fear to explore&#151;and perhaps the reason they fear to explore them.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Deep Knowledge (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a deep walker gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (dungeoneering), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks while underground (in caves and dungeons). Every 5 levels thereafter, the deep walker gains an additional +3 on each of those checks while underground (to a maximum of +11 at 18th level). This ability replaces favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Rock Hopper (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a deep walker instinctively grasps for the most stable surfaces and holds on tighter while moving over underground rock and stone. The deep walker gains a +5 bonus on all Acrobatics and Climb checks made to traverse underground terrain. Furthermore, the deep walker ignores difficult terrain created by underground terrain and subterranean flora. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Deep Walker Camouflage (Ex): </b>At 12th level, a deep walker can use the Stealth skill to hide in underground environments, even if the terrain does not grant cover or concealment. This ability replaces camouflage.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Stone (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a deep walker can use the Stealth skill while he is underground, even when being observed. This ability replaces hide in plain sight.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
					<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.)

				<name type="string">Hunter's Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
					<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>

Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>

				<name type="string">Master Hunter</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Those plying the lightless waters of the Darklands learn to use sound to augment their compromised vision, providing insight into the hazards lurking below the surface. A Darklands sailor has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			</table>
			<p><b>Skilled Pilot (Ex): </b>A Darklands sailor adds half his level (minimum 1) to Profession (sailor) and Survival checks to navigate or avoid natural hazards in subterranean waterways.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Ear (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a Darklands sailor learns how to use sound to compensate for poor visibility when facing threats above and below the water. He gains the uncanny dodge rogue ability when underground and either swimming or aboard a boat. At 8th level, he gains improved uncanny dodge under these conditions, treating his Darklands sailor level as his effective rogue level for the purpose of denying an enemy&#146;s sneak attacks. At 13th level, he gains blind sense with a range of 30 feet against creatures touching water. At 18th level, his blind sense range increases to 60 feet or equal to the range of his darkvision, whichever is greater. If the Darklands sailor becomes deafened, he loses all benefits of this ability until his hearing is restored.</p>
			<p>This replaces favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Quick Swim (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a Darklands sailor can swim at his full speed as a move action without penalty.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Subsonic Warning (Ex): </b>At 8th level as a swift action, a Darklands sailor can provide the benefits of his keen ear ability to the subjects of his hunter&#146;s bond. This effect lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the Darklands sailor&#146;s Wisdom modifier. These rounds need not be consecutive. A deafened creature can&#146;t benefit from a Darklands sailor&#146;s subsonic warning.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Hidden Depths (Ex): </b>At 12th level, a Darklands sailor can use the Stealth skill to hide while underground or underwater, even if he doesn&#146;t have cover or concealment. At 17th level, he can use the Stealth skill even while being observed when underground or underwater.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces camouflage and hide in plain sight.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>A dandy can alter the flow and spread of rumors in his favor. This functions similarly to wild empathy, except that it takes 1 day (8 hours of work), instead of 1 minute, and it affects the general tenor of a rumor instead of a wild animal.</p>
					<p>A successful rumor empathy check allows the dandy to increase or decrease the rumor&#146;s tone by one step. For example, he could make an indifferent rumor friendly and thus positive toward its target, or an unfriendly rumor hostile and thus even more negative toward its target than it was originally.</p>
					<p>The difficulty of influencing a rumor depends on the size of the community in which it is spreading. The DC of the check is 15 in a village or smaller settlement. This DC increases by 5 and the number of days required to attempt the check increases by 2 for every settlement size category larger than a village&#151;to a maximum of DC 40 and 11 days to affect a rumor spreading through an entire metropolis.</p>
					<p>If the rumor is only spreading through a smaller segment of the population, such as the elven district in a larger metropolis, use the population of that smaller segment to determine the DC and number of days of work required to use rumor empathy. The DC also increases by 10 if the rumor is about the dandy himself, since the dandy is obviously a biased source with respects to rumors about his own person.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The antithesis of the gruff and wild woodsmen, a dandy takes effort to master the subtle etiquette of noble courts, the whispers of dark rumors, and the customs of the cultured world. Nonetheless, he is still a ranger at heart, and he hunts for rumors and gossip throughout the grand ballrooms of the wealthy and powerful just as most rangers hunt for enemies in the wilderness.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Nation (Ex): </b>Each time he would select a favored enemy, a dandy instead selects a country with whose courtly graces he is wholly versed and studied. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against courtiers, officials, nobles, and gentry from that nation. Likewise, he gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them.</p>
			<p>A dandy can attempt the appropriate Knowledge checks untrained to identify such people from the selected country. A dandy gains additional favored nations, and can increase the bonuses of one of his current favored nations, in the same way he would with a normal ranger&#146;s favored enemy.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces favored enemy.</p>
			<p><b>Rumor Empathy (Ex): </b>A dandy can alter the flow and spread of rumors in his favor. This functions similarly to wild empathy, except that it takes 1 day (8 hours of work), instead of 1 minute, and it affects the general tenor of a rumor instead of a wild animal.</p>
			<p>A successful rumor empathy check allows the dandy to increase or decrease the rumor&#146;s tone by one step. For example, he could make an indifferent rumor friendly and thus positive toward its target, or an unfriendly rumor hostile and thus even more negative toward its target than it was originally.</p>
			<p>The difficulty of influencing a rumor depends on the size of the community in which it is spreading. The DC of the check is 15 in a village or smaller settlement. This DC increases by 5 and the number of days required to attempt the check increases by 2 for every settlement size category larger than a village&#151;to a maximum of DC 40 and 11 days to affect a rumor spreading through an entire metropolis.</p>
			<p>If the rumor is only spreading through a smaller segment of the population, such as the elven district in a larger metropolis, use the population of that smaller segment to determine the DC and number of days of work required to use rumor empathy. The DC also increases by 10 if the rumor is about the dandy himself, since the dandy is obviously a biased source with respects to rumors about his own person.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a dandy gains favored terrain (urban), and though the ability continues to increase at the same levels, he doesn&#146;t add additional terrains. However, at 8th level, whenever he is at a courtly function or party, his favored terrain bonuses increase by an additional 2.</p>
			<p><b>Dandy Spells (Su): </b>At 4th level, the dandy gains a different sort of spellcasting than most rangers. A dandy uses his Charisma instead of his Wisdom to determine spells per day, DCs, and other factors related to spellcasting. He casts spells spontaneously from the bard spell list (rather than the ranger spell list) with the same number of spells known and spells per day as a medium (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 30) of his ranger level.</p>
			<p>This ability alters the ranger&#146;s spellcasting.</p>
			<p><b>Hobnob (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a dandy must choose his allies as his hunter&#146;s bond, not an animal companion. In addition to the usual hunter&#146;s bond ability, the dandy can spend 10 minutes at a particular event or party hobnobbing and introducing his allies to the right people in order to provide them with half the skill bonuses of his favored nation (though not the bonuses on attack and damage rolls) for the duration of the event.</p>
			<p>This ability alters hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Party Crasher (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the dandy is able to finagle his way into fancy parties, kings&#146; balls, and other social events meant for the cream of society. To do so, he must attempt a DC 25 Diplomacy check, which takes 1d4 hours. If he succeeds, he finds himself an invitation, an invitee looking for a date, a staff member willing to look the other way, or some other way to enter the party. This does not allow him to break into restricted areas or to infiltrate strictly closed gatherings, such as secret meetings; it only allows him access to social events.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a corpse hunter must select undead as his first and only favored enemy, granting him a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks when dealing with creatures of the undead type and a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against undead. A corpse hunter does not gain additional favored enemies at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, though his favored enemy bonus against undead creatures increases by 2 at each of these levels (to a maximum bonus of +10 at 20th level).</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 5th level, a corpse hunter can infuse his attacks with divine power capable of harming an undead creature as well as its controller. As a standard action, the corpse hunter can make a single melee attack against an undead creature, or a single ranged attack against an undead creature within 30 feet. If the attack is successful, he deals 1d4 points of Charisma damage to the target undead creature in addition to normal damage. If the target undead creature is being controlled by another creature within 120 feet, the controller takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage as well; unlike the initial target, the controller may attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the corpse hunter&#146;s class level + the corpse hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier) to halve the damage she would take from this attack. A corpse hunter can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus an additional time per day at 10th level, 15th level, and 20th level. The amount of Charisma damage dealt increases to 1d6 at 10th level, 1d8 at 15th level, and 2d4 at 20th level.</p>

					<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

				<name type="string">Hunter's Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Many rangers count the undead among their favored enemies, but some make a full-time job out of hunting down and destroying these walking corpses. A corpse hunter has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Undead Exterminator: </b>At 1st level, a corpse hunter must select undead as his first and only favored enemy, granting him a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks when dealing with creatures of the undead type and a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against undead. A corpse hunter does not gain additional favored enemies at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, though his favored enemy bonus against undead creatures increases by 2 at each of these levels (to a maximum bonus of +10 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>In addition to the default spells on the ranger spell list, a corpse hunter adds the following to his list of spells at the indicated spell levels: 1st&#151;bless water, detect undead, hide from undead, sanctify corpseUM, 2nd&#151; halt undead, 3rd&#151;speak with dead, 4th&#151;searing light.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Disrupt Control (Su): </b>At 5th level, a corpse hunter can infuse his attacks with divine power capable of harming an undead creature as well as its controller. As a standard action, the corpse hunter can make a single melee attack against an undead creature, or a single ranged attack against an undead creature within 30 feet. If the attack is successful, he deals 1d4 points of Charisma damage to the target undead creature in addition to normal damage. If the target undead creature is being controlled by another creature within 120 feet, the controller takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage as well; unlike the initial target, the controller may attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the corpse hunter&#146;s class level + the corpse hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier) to halve the damage she would take from this attack. A corpse hunter can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus an additional time per day at 10th level, 15th level, and 20th level. The amount of Charisma damage dealt increases to 1d6 at 10th level, 1d8 at 15th level, and 2d4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Graveyard Stride (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a corpse hunter may move easily through difficult terrain in areas where corpses are interred, such as graveyards, catacombs, crypts, or necropolises. When in such an environment, the corpse hunter may move at his normal speed without taking damage or suffering any impairment, although any magical effects and enchantments that impair movement still affect him. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Incorporeal Armament (Su): </b>At 8th level, a corpse hunter can channel his will into any weapon he wields, making it effective against incorporeal undead. A corpse hunter may imbue a single wielded weapon with the ghost touch special ability as a swift action, causing it to deal damage normally against incorporeal creatures. The corpse hunter may use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to half his ranger level; these rounds need not be consecutive. The corpse hunter can end this ability as a free action. This ability replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>A code runner learns to memorize and accurately recall information, even if he does not speak or understand the language in which the information was presented. The code runner can spend 1 hour and attempt a DC 15 Linguistics check to memorize a single passage of up to 150 words of information in a language he speaks.</p>
					<p>For every 5 by which he exceeds the DC, he can memorize 150 additional words. The DC is increased by 10 if the message is encoded or in a language he doesn&#146;t understand. A code runner can memorize one such message at any given time. If he fails to memorize a message, he can retry as many times as he wants, as long as he spends 1 hour each time. Once a message has been memorized, he can recall it with perfect accuracy until he memorizes a different message.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A code runner specializes in the subtle and speedy transfer of secret messages. He performs long runs between distant lands, sometimes spanning continents and often traversing difficult terrain. He trains his mind both to memorize long messages and to resist any attempts to steal his covert communiques.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Mnemonic Genius (Ex): </b>A code runner learns to memorize and accurately recall information, even if he does not speak or understand the language in which the information was presented. The code runner can spend 1 hour and attempt a DC 15 Linguistics check to memorize a single passage of up to 150 words of information in a language he speaks.</p>
			<p>For every 5 by which he exceeds the DC, he can memorize 150 additional words. The DC is increased by 10 if the message is encoded or in a language he doesn&#146;t understand. A code runner can memorize one such message at any given time. If he fails to memorize a message, he can retry as many times as he wants, as long as he spends 1 hour each time. Once a message has been memorized, he can recall it with perfect accuracy until he memorizes a different message.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Resist Interrogation (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a code runner gains a bonus equal to half his ranger level on saving throws against divination effects. At 11th level, if he succeeds at a saving throw against a divination effect that would grant its caster knowledge or information, the caster is not aware that the saving throw was successful, and the code runner can attempt a Bluff check opposed by the caster&#146;s Sense Motive check in order to send false information to the caster.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Cinderwalkers traverse burning wastelands and restless mountains, thriving in lands most creatures avoid.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Born to the Fire (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a cinderwalker gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks when in volcanic or geothermally active areas. Such areas include calderas, hot springs, lava plains, and volcanically formed hills or mountains. In addition, the cinderwalker adds this bonus on any ability checks, saving throws, or skill checks to avoid geothermal or volcanic hazards. The cinderwalker can choose to improve this bonus in place of improving a favored terrain bonus. A cinderwalker traveling through volcanic or geothermally active areas leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he can leave a trail if he chooses). This ability replaces the cinderwalker&#146;s first favored terrain and wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Inured (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a cinderwalker gains the benefits of endure elements against hot environments. At 8th level, the cinderwalker gains fire resistance 10, which improves to fire resistance 20 at 12th level, fire resistance 30 at 16th level, and immunity to fire at 20th level. This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Cinderwalk (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a cinderwalker can move through any sort of solid volcanic terrain (such as ash, cooled lava, or volcanic rock) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. The cinderwalker ignores fire damage from being near heat sources and touching heated surfaces (but not from immersion). This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain: </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Thanks to their four arms, kasathas can master a combat form native to their home world and rarely witnessed on Golarion&#151;wielding two bows at once. This archetype is available to kasathas (and to other races with four or more arms at the GM&#146;s discretion).</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Twin Bows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a bow nomad can simultaneously wield a combination of two of any of the following ranged weapons: shortbow, longbow, and their composite versions. When a bow nomad makes a full attack with two bows, twoweapon penalties apply and can be offset with Two- Weapon Fighting feats. Since bows aren&#146;t light weapons, a bow nomad with Two-Weapon Fighting takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks with each of her bows. Extra attacks from other sources, such as those granted by Manyshot or Rapid Shot, can be applied to only one of the wielded bows per round. This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a bow nomad must select archery as her combat style. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Agile Maneuvers: </b>At 3rd level, a bow nomad gains Agile Maneuvers as a bonus feat. This replaces Endurance.</p>
			<p><b>Trick Shot (Ex): </b>A bow nomad can make a number of trick shots per day equal to 1/2 her ranger level + her Dexterity modifier. Unless otherwise noted, making a trick shot is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p><i>Deflecting Arrow: </i>At 3rd level, as an immediate action that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity, a bow nomad can deflect a single ranged attack. This ability functions as the Deflect Arrows feat, except the bow nomad need not have a hand free and can def lect an attack targeting any creature within 30 feet.</p>
			<p><i>Hampering Strike: </i>At 8th level, a bow nomad can attempt to disarm or trip an opponent within 30 feet in place of a ranged attack, with a &#150;4 penalty on the combat maneuver check.</p>
			<p><i>Pinning Strike: </i>At 13th level, a bow nomad can attempt to pin a Large or smaller opponent&#146;s limb or clothing to the ground or a wall in place of an attack. If the bow nomad&#146;s attack roll exceeds her opponent&#146;s CMD, the opponent is pinned and cannot move from its current position. As a move action, the opponent can attempt a Strength check to free itself (DC = 10 + 1/2 the bow nomad&#146;s ranger level + her Strength modifier). Only creatures adjacent to a solid, anchored, penetrable surface can be affected by this ability.</p>
			<p><i>Exploit the Gap: </i>At 18th level, a bow nomad can exploit the natural weaknesses of her foes. When a bow nomad makes a full attack with her twin bows, each arrow that deals damage in that attack also reduces the target&#146;s natural armor bonus (if any) by 1 (to a minimum of 0) for 1 round.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Focused Fire (Ex): </b>At 6th level, the bow nomad must select the Manyshot feat as her 6th-level combat style feat. In addition to the normal benefit of Manyshot, the bow nomad can specify the bow in her off hands as the source of the second arrow (precision damage and critical damage are still only added once). The bow nomad takes no two-weapon penalties when using this ability, but she cannot use it and Two-Weapon Fighting in the same round. The nomad can still choose to use Manyshot in the normal manner.</p>
			<p>At 11th and 16th level, the bow nomad can apply this ability to each of her iterative attacks. This ability alters the 6th-level combat style feat and replaces camouflage and hide in plain sight.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

Saving throw DCs for this ability are calculated as if the blightwarden had the relevant template (for example, the DC of an ability from the blighted fey template would be equal to 10 + half the blightwarden&#146;s Hit Dice + his Constitution modifier). He cannot use abilities that would create a permanent effect beyond this ability&#146;s duration, and can never use more than one ability from a template or subtype in this way during a single 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some rangers feel so closely connected to their homelands that they stand as guardians against pervasive corruptions that pervert those lands beyond the point of recognition.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Blightwalker (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a blightwarden gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks when in areas afflicted by a natural or supernatural blight. Blighted areas include cursed lands (Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures 143), domains of evil (Horror Adventures 159), regions negatively affected by a spell or ability that affects at least a 300-square-foot area, or regions where a specific affliction is prevalent. In addition, the blightwarden adds this bonus to ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks to avoid natural and supernatural hazards in blighted areas. He can choose to improve this bonus in place of improving a favored terrain bonus. A blightwarden traveling through blighted areas leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he can leave a trail if he chooses).</p>
			<p>This alters favored terrain and replaces the blightwarden&#146;s first favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Corruption (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a blightwarden gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against curses, diseases, mind-affecting effects, poisons, and transmutation effects.</p>
			<p>This replaces endurance.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>A beast master forms a close bond with an animal companion. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger&#146;s effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks made regarding his animal companion. Unlike a normal ranger, a beast master&#146;s choice of animal companion is not limited to a subset of all possibile animal companion choices&#151;he may choose freely among all animal companion choices, just as a druid can.</p>
					<p>The beast master may have more than one animal companion, but he must divide up his effective druid level between his companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a beast master with an effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion. Each time a beast master&#146;s effective druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the ranger&#146;s service (he must release a companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion). The share spells animal companion ability does not give the ranger the ability to cast a single spell so that it affects all of his animal companions. This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some rangers, particularly those in primitive lands or who were raised by animals, have unusually strong bonds with animals. Unique among rangers, they can bond with multiple animals of any kind, creating a menagerie of wild yet loyal creatures, like a strange family. A beast master has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>A beast master&#146;s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Wis). These replace the standard ranger class skills.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>A beast master forms a close bond with an animal companion. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger&#146;s effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks made regarding his animal companion. Unlike a normal ranger, a beast master&#146;s choice of animal companion is not limited to a subset of all possibile animal companion choices&#151;he may choose freely among all animal companion choices, just as a druid can.</p>
			<p>The beast master may have more than one animal companion, but he must divide up his effective druid level between his companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a beast master with an effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion. Each time a beast master&#146;s effective druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the ranger&#146;s service (he must release a companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion). The share spells animal companion ability does not give the ranger the ability to cast a single spell so that it affects all of his animal companions. This ability replaces hunter&#146;s bond.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>The beast master gains an empathic link with all of his animal companions. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the ranger can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as he likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The ranger can only see through the eyes of one companion at a time, and is blinded while maintaining this connection. This replaces the 6th-level combat style feat.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Strong Bond (Ex): </b>At 12th level, the ranger strengthens his bond with his animal companions. The ranger&#146;s effective druid level for his animal companions is now equal to his ranger level; he may immediately allocate these additional levels to his companions as he sees fit. This ability replaces camouflage.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions.

This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion.

If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Armies need clean water, safe routes, and intelligence about their enemies. Though regular outdoorsmen might suffice in many cases, some large forces look to battle scouts to keep the body of their troops safe and prepared for the terrain and whatever dangers that terrain hides.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>
			<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a battle scout gains the hunter&#146;s bond ability, he must choose to bond with his companions. Battle scouts do not have animal companions.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Advantageous Terrain (Ex): </b>At 5th level, when a battle scout is within one of his favorite terrains, he can spend up to 3 consecutive rounds studying an area of terrain to gain the benefits below. Each round of studying terrain is a standard action. During the first round of studying terrain, the battle scout designates a 60-foot-radius-burst area from a single square within line of sight. Depending on how many rounds the battle scout spends studying the area, he or his allies gain the following benefits for 10 minutes per ranger level he possesses. (For example, if he spends 2 rounds, he or his allies gain the first two benefits.)</p>
			<p><i>1st Round: </i>Allies within line of sight and that can hear the battle scout gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks while within the advantageous terrain area.</p>
			<p><i>2nd Round: </i>Allies within line of sight and that can hear the battle scout gain a +2 on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks while within the advantageous terrain area.</p>
			<p><i>3rd Round: </i>The battle scout&#146;s movement is not hampered by difficult terrain while within the advantageous terrain area. Furthermore, the battle scout can take 10 on Climb and Swim checks and checks to jump while within the area, even when in immediate danger or distracted. This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s second favored enemy.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Infiltration (Ex): </b>At 10th level, once per day, a battle scout can choose a single terrain type that is not his favored terrain. For the next hour per ranger level, he treats that terrain as if it were one of his favored terrains. This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s third favorite enemy.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Superior Tactics (Ex): </b>At 15th level, once per day, after a battle scout and his allies roll initiative, the battle scout can arrange his and his allies&#146; initiative rolls any way he wishes. If he has already taken 3 rounds to scout out the terrain with his advantageous terrain ability and both he and his allies are within the effect area, they gain a +2 bonus to initiative checks. Using this ability is not an action. This ability replaces the ranger&#146;s fourth favored enemy.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Advantage (Ex): </b>At 20th level, when using his advantageous terrain ability, a battle scout needs only to study the terrain as a standard action to gain all of the benefits. Furthermore, the area of his advantageous terrain increases to a 1-mile-radius spread from the single square within line of sight. This ability replaces master hunter.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
					<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>

				<name type="string">Spells</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
					<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>

In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 20th level, an Abendego diver is peerless at detecting prey underwater and delivering killing blows. He can notice other creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius underwater and can detect blood in the water up to a mile away. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus while underwater. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + half the ranger&#146;s level + the ranger&#146;s Wisdom modifier. An Abendego diver can instead deal an additional amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature&#146;s current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. An Abendego diver can use this ability once per day against each of his favored enemy types but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Named for the vicious and unending storm in the southern Arcadian Ocean, Abendego divers have pushed their bodies to their limits, holding their breath to expand their lung capacity and swimming until ocean travel is second nature to them.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game&#151;even fugitives among their own people.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ranger's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, harpoons and nets, and with light armor, medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Deep Diver (Ex): </b>At 1st level, an Abendego diver can hold his breath for twice as long as usual (4 rounds times his Constitution score instead of the normal 2).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>
			<p>If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from&#151;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>

			<p><b>Ocean&#146;s Blessing: </b>An Abendego diver adds buoyancyACG, control water, elemental speechAPG (water only), hydraulic pushAPG, hydraulic torrentAPG, ride the wavesUM, river whipACG, water breathing, and wave shieldACG to his ranger spell list at the same spell level as they appear on the cleric spell list or sorcerer/wizard spell list, whichever is lower. He still must select them as spells known, as normal.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Style Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>
			<p>The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Aquatic Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an Abendego diver gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks while underwater. Every 5 levels thereafter, the bonus on each of those checks increases by 2 while the Abendego diver is underwater (to a maximum of +8 at 18th level).</p>
			<p>This replaces favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter's Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: Antelope, Armorfish, Baboon, Badger, Bird (Eagle/Hawk/Owl), Bustard, Camel, Capybara, Cat, Small (Cheetah, Leopard), Constrictor Snake, Dire Rat, Dog, Elk, Falcon, Hobbe Hound, Horse, Kangaroo, Lizard (Giant Gecko), Marsupial Devil, Pony, Ram, Reef Snake, Reef Snake, Reindeer, Shark, Spitting Cobra, Stag, Stingray, Swan, Trumpeter, Thylacine, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Wolfdog, Yak, Zebra. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose from this list instead: Armorfish, Reef Snake, Shark, Stingray. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.</p>
			<p>This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in Spell Lists. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p><b>Aquatic Adaptation (Ex): </b>At 7th level, an Abendego diver gains a swim speed equal to his unmodified base speed. Because he has a swim speed, he gains the standard +8 bonus on Swim checks to perform a special action or evade a hazard, the ability to take 10 on a Swim check even if distracted or threatened, and the ability to use the run action while swimming if he swims in a straight line. If he already has a swim speed, his swim speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
			<p>This replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Shark Sense (Ex): </b>At 8th level, an Abendego diver gains the scent ability while underwater.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Killer of the Deep (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an Abendego diver is peerless at detecting prey underwater and delivering killing blows. He can notice other creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius underwater and can detect blood in the water up to a mile away. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus while underwater. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + half the ranger&#146;s level + the ranger&#146;s Wisdom modifier. An Abendego diver can instead deal an additional amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature&#146;s current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. An Abendego diver can use this ability once per day against each of his favored enemy types but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces master hunter.</p>
