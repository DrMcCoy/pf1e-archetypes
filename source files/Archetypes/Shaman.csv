Failure means that the controlling effect ends or the entity is immediately cast out of the target, as appropriate. If the possessing entity is exorcised, it cannot attempt to dominate or possess that target again for 24 hours. The animist can exorcise the same entity out of different targets, but once the entity successfully saves against the animist's exorcism, it cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours.

She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit.

At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg

When choosing her wandering spirit for the day, the possessed shaman chooses one skill. The possessed shaman treats this skill as if she had a number of ranks in it equal to her shaman level, and uses her Wisdom modifier in place of the ability modifier the skill would normally use. If the skill is a class skill, she receives the usual +3 bonus on skill checks for having ranks in that skill. Each time the possessed shaman changes her wandering spirit, she can also change the skill gained through this ability. These ranks do not stack with her other skill ranks (only the higher number of ranks applies). This ability replaces the wandering hex gained at 6th level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg

,Shaman,"[[""Shaman""],[""Animist""]]",Shaman (Animist),Animist,<id-00007,2,Wrangle Condition,"<p>At 2nd level, the animist interacts directly with unwholesome spirits of the ills that trouble him or his people. To the animist, negative conditions manifest as anthropomorphic spirits or are caused by such spirits (visited upon the creature by bad magic). Either way, the animist can attempt to persuade the spirit to leave its victim alone, thus performing a miraculous healing. As the animist grows in power, he can simply inform these spirits that they are unwelcome and command them to depart.</p><p>The animist can attempt a Diplomacy check to persuade the condition's spirit to leave. Conditions the animist can affect are ranked from minor to dire, with each category having an accompanying Diplomacy DC (see below). The animist cannot take 10 or 20 on the check or receive aid from any creature except another shaman. Failure by 5 or less means the condition spirit is willing to leave the target and transfer to the animist for the rest of the duration or until cured; this happens only if the animist is willing. Failure by 10 or more means that not only is the target inflicted with the condition, but the animist is as well (whether or not he is willing) for the remaining duration or until cured.</p><p><i>Minor Conditions (DC 15): </i>Fatigued, shaken, and sickened.</p><p><i>Major Conditions (DC 20): </i>Dazed and staggered.</p><p><i>Severe Conditions (DC 25): </i>Exhausted, frightened, and nauseated.</p><p><i>Dire Conditions (DC 30): </i>Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned.</p><p>The animist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his shaman level + his Wisdom modifier. Using this ability is a standard action that requires no contact or shared language with the target, but it relies on audible components and the target must be within 30 feet. If a target is afflicted with multiple conditions, the animist targets one condition at a time (of her choosing). The animist cannot use this ability on himself.</p><p>At 5th level, the animist can use this ability to exorcise minor conditions without needing to attempt a Diplomacy check. He can dispatch major conditions without a roll at 9th level, severe conditions at 13th level, and dire conditions at 17th level. Doing so still requires one use of this ability per condition.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg
