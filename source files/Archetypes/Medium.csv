Furthermore, if the relic channeler gains the apport object spell, she can use it to receive her relics without casting it on them in advance in the same way. The range at which the relic channeler can apport her relics (both with this ability and the spell) increases by an additional 5 feet for every 2 levels she possesses beyond 5th. This ability replaces location channel.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Kami Medium""]]",Medium (Kami Medium),Kami Medium,<id-00020,13,Ask the Kami,"<p>At 13th level, a kami medium can ask the local kami for information, as commune with nature. While he can do so any number of times per day, he can ask questions of the kami in any particular area only once per day. Afterward, he must move to a non-overlapping area to use this ability again. This ability replaces ask the spirits.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg

,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Spirit Dancer""]]",Medium (Spirit Dancer),Spirit Dancer,<id-00023,18,Attacca,"<p>At 18th level, a spirit dancer learns how to shift rapidly into the next movement of his dance. He no longer takes a penalty after his spirit dance ends and can enter another spirit dance immediately.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Voice of the Void""]]",Medium (Voice of the Void),Voice of the Void,<id-00028,2,Blasphemy,"<p>Emissaries demand that a medium perform acts appealing to their alien whims. These work just like taboos for an ordinary medium, but in addition to the base taboo, they require bizarre and alien acts that distance the voice of the void from his own humanity. These blasphemies cause the medium to take a -1 penalty on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks whenever he accepts a taboo. The increased devotion required to maintain a blasphemy reaps a greater reward, however. If the voice of the void is under a blasphemy, the die for his spirit surge changes from 1d6 to 1d8, increasing to 1d10 at 10th level and 1d12 at 20th level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Reanimated Medium""]]",Medium (Reanimated Medium),Reanimated Medium,<id-00026,1,Channel Self,"<p>A reanimated medium is essentially a bodiless spirit using influence to possess his own spiritless body. 'The reanimated medium' refers to this spirit. Unlike a normal medium, a reanimated medium becomes more powerful the more influence it has over its body. Each day, the reanimated medium can perform a seance at a location as normal to focus on one of his potential future legends. He channels that legendary potential as strongly as possible into his body. The spirit gains 3 points of influence over his body, to a maximum of 6 points. Since he is his own possessing spirit, he doesn't lose control at 5 or more points of influence, though he still suffers the legend's influence penalty as normal at 3 or more points of influence. All effects and abilities that normally increase or decrease influence (such as spirit surge and spirit powers) have the opposite effect on a reanimated medium (for instance, propitiation increases influence by 1 point and spirit surge reduces influence by 1 point); this does not apply to the new abilities from the reanimated medium archetype. A reanimated medium can't choose to channel a weaker spirit to avoid losing influence from using spirit surge. The body of a reanimated medium who reaches 0 points of influence enters a deathlike coma and is helpless for 24 hours, after which the reanimated medium reverts to 1 point of influence if the body is still alive, but can't perform a seance for another 24 hours.</p><p>A character who selects the reanimated medium archetype after 1st level can do so only after dying; at the GM's discretion, a dead character of another class with an intact body who has earned enough experience points to level up can take a level in medium and gain the reanimated medium archetype, and a dead medium might be able to gain this archetype. In any case, being revived from gaining the reanimated medium archetype does not impart any negative levels or other ill effects.</p><p>This ability alters spirit.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Relic Channeler""]]",Medium (Relic Channeler),Relic Channeler,<id-00018,7,Connection Specialty,"<p>At 7th level, a relic channeler gains connection channel and can use that ability as a normal medium, despite not possessing location channel. She requires familiarity to use this ability, even if she is in an appropriate location. This ability alters connection channel.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Spirit Eater""]]",Medium (Spirit Eater),Spirit Eater,<id-00018,7,Consume Spirit,"<p>At 7th level, a spirit eater can attempt to consume an incorporeal creature and house it within his body. If he reduces an incorporeal creature to 0 hit points or fewer, he can instead leave the creature at 1 hit point and consume the creature as an immediate action. A consumed creature is contained in the spirit eater's body and grants him a +1 bonus on either attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks, chosen by the spirit eater, and a number of temporary hit points equal to the consumed creature's Hit Dice.</p><p>A spirit eater's body can hold a number of creatures equal to his spirit bonus. If he attempts to consume another creature after this point, he releases the creature that has been contained in his body longest. He can release a consumed creature as a free action. A consumed creature attempts to escape after 24 hours. The spirit eater can attempt to keep a consumed creature in his body by attempting a Will save (DC = 10 + half the spirit eater's level + twice the number of the creatures he has contained in his body). If he succeeds, the consumed creatures remain, but they grant the spirit eater's channeled spirit 1 point of influence over him. A released creature is destroyed as if it were reduced to 0 hit points and can reconstitute again later, if able.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Spirit Dancer""]]",Medium (Spirit Dancer),Spirit Dancer,<id-00025,20,Dance of Infinite Forms,"<p>At 20th level, a spirit dancer has perfected his dance. He can now use each of his supreme spirit powers' once-per-day abilities one time each day, instead of just one ability. He can use his spirit troika by spending 2 rounds of spirit dance instead of 3. Finally, he can enter a spirit dance with all six of his prepared spirits at once by spending 4 rounds of spirit dance each round.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Fiend Keeper""]]",Medium (Fiend Keeper),Fiend Keeper,<id-00016,3,Dark Communion,"<p>At 3rd level, a fiend keeper can entice the evil spirit to lend him its knowledge or its power as a full-round action a number of times per day equal to his class level. If the fiend keeper seeks knowledge, this behaves as contact other plane using his medium level as his caster level, but if he fails the Intelligence or Charisma check, his spirit gains 1 point of inf luence over him instead of reducing his ability scores. Treat the spirit as an entity from the Astral Plane for this ability. Its knowledge is equivalent to that of a demigod at 5th level, a lesser deity at 7th level, and an intermediate deity at 13th level.</p><p>If the fiend keeper requests power, he must instead succeed at an Intelligence or Charisma check (DC 10 at 3rd level, DC 12 at 7th level, or DC 14 at 13th level or higher), or his spirit gains 1 point of inf luence over him. Regardless of the outcome, he gains one of the following powers for 1 minute. At 5th level, he also gains a number of temporary hit points equal to his medium level for 1 minute. At 7th level, he selects two powers.</p><p>Dark Power: The fiend keeper gains a +1 profane bonus on attack and damage rolls, and a +1 profane bonus to AC. At 13th level, these bonuses increase to +2. Fiendish Form: The fiend keeper gains darkvision 60 feet. At 7th level, he grows fiendish wings and gains a fly speed equal to his base speed (average maneuverability). At 13th level, his fly speed instead equals double his base speed (good maneuverability).</p><p>Natural Attacks: The fiend keeper gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. These are primary attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if the fiend keeper is Medium). At 13th level, the damage increases to 1d6 (1d8 if Medium).</p><p>Spirit Power: The fiend keeper's spirit bonus increases by 1. At 13th level, the spirit bonus instead increases by 2.</p><p>Unholy Resilience: The fiend keeper gains resistance 5 to two of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The resistance increases to 10 at 7th level and 20 at 13th level.</p><p>This ability replaces haunt channeler, location channel, connection channel, and ask the spirits.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg

A medium of the master can channel that spirit in places of quiet introspection, such as a Darklands grotto, peaceful glade, or windswept peak, in addition to a champion spirit's favored locations.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Medium of the Master""]]",Medium (Medium of the Master),Medium of the Master,<id-00027,1,Dedicated Surge,"<p>A medium of the master can use her spirit surge ability twice per day without incurring any influence (this stacks with any additional uses she gains from accepting a taboo, starting at 2nd level). In addition, when she uses spirit surge, the die she rolls is one step larger (1d8 at 1st level, 1d10 at 10th level, and 2d6 at 20th level).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Storyteller""]]",Medium (Storyteller),Storyteller,<id-00016,1,Diminished Spirits,"<p>A storyteller does not receive his spirit's seance boon. He can't choose to channel a weaker spirit to reduce his influence from spirit surge. Because of his obsession with legends, he begins with 2 points of influence after a seance rather than 1.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Storm Dreamer""]]",Medium (Storm Dreamer),Storm Dreamer,<id-00017,5,Dream Storm,"<p>At 5th level, a storm dreamer's thoughts can cause magical weather effects to manifest. While in a storm trance, she can cast call lightning, sleet storm, and wind wall as spell-like abilities (CL = her character level). Each time she casts one of these spell-like abilities, she reduces the number of remaining minutes for her storm trance by 1 minute; she can't use these spell-like abilities if she has less than 1 minute remaining for the day to use her storm trance.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Reanimated Medium""]]",Medium (Reanimated Medium),Reanimated Medium,<id-00016,3,Ease Passage,"<p>At 3rd level, as long as a reanimated medium's body is intact, it's easy for him to return to it. He takes only 1 negative level instead of 2 from raise dead. This ability replaces haunt channeler.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Spirit Eater""]]",Medium (Spirit Eater),Spirit Eater,<id-00016,3,Ectoplasmic Strikes,"<p>At 3rd level, a spirit eater medium treats his attacks as if they had the ghost touch weapon property.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Voice of the Void""]]",Medium (Voice of the Void),Voice of the Void,<id-00026,1,Emissary,"<p>A voice of the void channels entities called emissaries, which emulate the six legends but possess a different kind of inscrutable, alien power. They originate in a place that no mortal mind can comprehend, and their power merely passes through the astral realm to reach the medium. For each point of influence an emissary gains over a medium, the medium takes a -1 penalty on Will saves, Wisdom checks, and Wisdombased skill checks, in addition to the other penalties imposed by the emissary's influence. If an emissary gains enough influence to take control of him, when the medium awakens, in addition to performing the bidding of the alien entity, he retains faint memories of horrible things in dark places and takes 2d4 points of Wisdom damage.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Fiend Keeper""]]",Medium (Fiend Keeper),Fiend Keeper,<id-00026,1,Evil Spirit,"<p>A fiend keeper serves as the vessel for a powerful evil spirit that fights and bargains for dominance. The legends a fiend keeper channels are all aspects of this evil presence. Willingly performing an evil act automatically grants the evil spirit 1 point of influence over him. Protection from evil temporarily suppresses all the spirit's benefits while the fiend keeper is under the spell's effects. When the spirit gains at least 3 points of influence over the fiend keeper, in addition to the penalties associated with each legend, he gains an evil aura as per a cleric of his level and treats his alignment as evil for the purposes of resisting or being vulnerable to spells and abilities (such as unholy blight or a paladin's smite evil class ability).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Storm Dreamer""]]",Medium (Storm Dreamer),Storm Dreamer,<id-00011,1,Gozreh's Domain,"<p>All storm dreamers are deeply religious and select one of the domains granted by Gozreh: Air, Animal, Plant, Water, or Weather. The storm dreamer gains the 1st-level granted power from her chosen domain, but never gains the second power at higher level. When determining the effect of the granted power, the storm dreamer's effective cleric level is equal to her storm dreamer level. The 1st- through 6th-level bonus spells from this domain are added to her spell list. Despite her faith, these spells are cast normally, as psychic spells, by the medium.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Rivethun Spirit Channeler""]]",Medium (Rivethun Spirit Channeler),Rivethun Spirit Channeler,<id-00016,7,Haunt Channeler,"<p>At 3rd level, a medium can use his familiarity with spirits to assist him when dealing with haunts. He can always act on the surprise round against a haunt, and his touch funnels a portion of the haunt into himself, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the haunt per 2 medium levels he possesses as if via positive energy and allowing the medium to ask the haunt a single question. The haunt can answer the question however it chooses. Additionally, the medium can forgo his saving throw against a haunt's effects to funnel the haunt entirely into himself. If he does so, the medium suffers the haunt's full effect, but the haunt doesn't affect anyone else (even if it normally would). The haunt then gains control of the medium's body for 24 hours. Once per minute, the medium can attempt to end this possession early by succeeding at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 the medium's class level).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Vessel of the Failed""]]",Medium (Vessel of the Failed),Vessel of the Failed,<id-00028,2,Heroic Exceptions,"<p>Each time a vessel of the failed breaks a taboo he has accepted, he can allow his spirit to gain 1 additional point of influence over him. When he does so, the penalty he takes on attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws changes from -2 to -1. This influence is in addition to the influence the spirit normally gains for breaking the taboo in the first place. If the vessel continues violating the taboo while taking a reduced penalty, the duration of the reduced penalty extends, but the spirit doesn't gain additional influence over the vessel.</p><p>This alters taboo.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Nexian Channeler""]]",Medium (Nexian Channeler),Nexian Channeler,<id-00016,3,Impossible Eye,"<p>Starting at 3rd level, a Nexian channeler gains additional powers from his third eye. At 3rd level, while his third eye is open, his caster level for divination spells increases by 1 and he gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. At 5th level, while his third eye is open, he gains constant detect magic. At 7th level, while his third eye is open, he gains constant arcane sight instead of detect magic. At 9th level, while his third eye is open, his bonus on Perception checks against invisible creatures improves to see invisibility. At 13th level, he can concentrate for 1 minute to send his third eye from his body, as per arcane eye (this duration counts against the daily duration for which he can open his third eye, and if the arcane eye is destroyed, he loses all remaining minutes of his third eye ability for that day). At 14th level, as a standard action while his third eye is open, he can spend 1 minute of the duration he can open his third eye to use analyze dweomer on a single target. At 15th level, while his third eye is open, he gains true seeing. At 18th level, while his third eye is open, his arcane sight improves to greater arcane sight.

,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Kami Medium""]]",Medium (Kami Medium),Kami Medium,<id-00026,1,Kami Channeler,"<p>A kami medium channels the kami at locations different from where a normal medium channels his spirits. The kami medium channels the dosojin (which acts as the trickster) at crossroads and other major roadway milestones; the fukujin (which acts as the marshal) at ornamental shrubs and bonsai trees; the kaminari (which acts as the champion) in the midst of storms; the suijin (which acts as the hierophant) at pure lakes, ponds, springs, and wells; and the zuishin (which acts as the guardian) at significant gates, doorways, and torii. The kami medium does not have access to the archmage legend. This ability alters spirit.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg
,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Medium of the Master""]]",Medium (Medium of the Master),Medium of the Master,<id-00022,15,Ki Contact,"<p>At 15th level, as a swift action, a medium of the master can allow her spirit to gain 1 point of influence over her in order to gain a ki power and a number of ki points equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1) until the spirit leaves her body. She uses her medium levels as monk levels for the purposes of meeting the ki power's prerequisites and any level-dependent benefits of the power.

At 10th level, he can spend 1d4 x 10 minutes and 10 rounds of storyteller's performance to gain the effects of legend lore. The subject must be at hand for the legend lore to function.

,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Reanimated Medium""]]",Medium (Reanimated Medium),Reanimated Medium,<id-00017,5,Lingering Spirit,"<p>At 5th level, a reanimated medium's spirit lingers for up to 1 round after death before departing if the medium spends 1 point of influence. If the reanimated medium died of hit point damage, healing works on his body during the intervening round and can bring him back to life. Once the spirit departs, the breath of life spell continues to work for 1 additional round, even though the reanimated medium has been dead for more than 1 round.

Any ally in the reanimated medium's presence can perform a seance to channel the reanimated medium (the seance takes 1 hour and is subject to the other rules for a medium's seance). Each ally can do this only once per day. At the end of the seance, the reanimated medium can choose to reduce his influence by 1 point. If the reanimated medium does so, some of his spirit seeps into that ally, which can then spend that 1 point of influence to use any of the reanimated medium's abilities that decrease influence.

,Medium,"[[""Medium""],[""Storyteller""]]",Medium (Storyteller),Storyteller,<id-00025,20,Living Story,"<p>At 20th level, a storyteller gains the ability to sweep others away into a story of his own making. He must perform for 1 full round, telling a tale to set the snare for his living story and spending 1 round of his storyteller's performance. At the end of that round, he can affect up to 30 Hit Dice of listeners within range with microcosm. Unlike with a normal microcosm, this is also a sonic and language-dependent ability, and a creature with 16 or more Hit Dice that succeeds at its save is immune to the storyteller's living story ability for 24 hours.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg

Each of his spells gains an ofuda as an additional inexpensive material component, and the ofuda replaces the divine focus for spells the kami medium gains via the divine surge spirit power. Unless the spell involves a touch attack or ranged touch attack, the kami medium doesn't need to attempt an attack roll to place an ofuda on an unwilling target; the ofuda simply appears on affected targets.

An ofuda counts as an object made of paper with 5 hit points per medium level. The target of the spell can't see, harm, or remove the ofuda attached to her, though her allies can do so.

At 5th level, it gains the abilities of a shikigami improved familiar (Bestiary 3 163), even if the kami medium doesn't meet the prerequisites for having a shikigami as a familiar.

He does not always possess the seance boon, spirit bonus, spirit powers, or spirit surge ability from any of these six spirits.</p><p>Instead, he can enter a spirit dance as a free action to gain the aforementioned abilities from one of the six spirits he prepared during his seance for the duration of his spirit dance. He can spirit dance for a total number of rounds per day equal to his Charisma modifier + double his medium level; these rounds don't need to be consecutive. After his spirit dance ends, the spirit dancer takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 minute and can't enter a spirit dance again during that time. He also can't enter a spirit dance while shaken, frightened, or panicked. He combines all influence incurred during spirit dances into a single pool. At 3 points of influence or higher, he takes a -2 penalty on initiative checks even when he's not in a spirit dance, and at 5 points of influence or higher, his current spirit takes control as it would for a normal medium (this control is not limited by rounds of spirit dance). A spirit dancer can accept 1 point of influence to recover 4 rounds of spirit dance, up to his normal daily maximum.</p><p>A spirit dancer continues to track daily uses of abilities from each of his spirits even while he is not in a spirit dance.
