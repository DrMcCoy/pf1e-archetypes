As an immediate action, when an opponent attempts an attack against the aerial assaulter, he can attempt a Fly check with a DC equal to the result of the attacker's attack roll. If he succeeds, he can take a 5-foot step and gain a dodge bonus to his AC equal to his Dexterity modifier. This movement doesn't negate the attack if the aerial assaulter remains in range of the attacking enemy's reach at the end of the 5-foot step. If the Fly check fails, the aerial assaulter does not move, does not gain an AC bonus, and provokes an attack of opportunity from each creature that threatens him, including the initial attacker. The aerial assaulter must be flying to use this ability.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_26.jpg

At 7th level, he can choose any of the five states of buoyancy once per turn as a free action, and can take his buoyancy movement as part of that free action instead of at the end of his turn without becoming off-balance and without requiring a Swim check; additionally, he can choose to double or halve how far a current moves him. At 11th level, whenever he takes a move, double move, withdraw, or run action underwater, he can leave a current behind him in the squares along his path; this current has a speed of 10 feet in the direction of his movement (if his movement was circuitous, so is the current) and lasts until the beginning of his next turn. At 15th level, as a full round action, an aquanaut can spin ferociously underwater, creating a whirlpool around himself with a spinning force that drags all creatures within 120 feet of him 30 feet closer to him. Creatures closer than 30 feet spend the 30 feet of movement circling around the aquanaut in a single direction of his choice. The whirlpool isn't fast enough to deal damage, but the aquanaut is unaffected by his own whirlpool, allowing him to make attacks of opportunity against creatures moving in it. At 19th level, the aquanaut learns to use the water around him to soften blows, gaining DR 5/- while underwater.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_26.jpg

Once per day, if an armiger is forced to take an action that is diametrically opposed to her order's beliefs and values while under the influence of a charm or compulsion effect, she can immediately attempt a Will save against the effect's DC to resist acting out that order. Success does not remove the existing charm or compulsion effect, but does allow the armiger to resist betraying her beliefs.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_26.jpg
