,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""War Painter""]]",Skald (War Painter),War Painter,<id-00023,7,Arcane Flourish,"<p>At 7th level, once per day as he finishes applying his furious paint to a creature, a war painter can cast one skald spell with a casting time of no more than 1 standard action and infuse the spell into the paint. Once while benefiting from the paint's raging song, the painted ally can use a standard action to cast the infused spell on herself as if the war painter had cast it. The spell ends when the paint's other effects end. A war painter can infuse only a skald spell whose level is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level skald spell he can cast. He can infuse any targeted spell in a painted ally, even if its range is personal. The war painter can use this ability twice per day at 13th level and three times per day at 19th level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg

,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Battle Scion""]]",Skald (Battle Scion),Battle Scion,<id-00031,3,Battle Prowess,"<p>Whenever a battle scion would gain a rage power from the skald's rage power ability (at 3rd level and every 3 skald levels thereafter), she can instead choose to gain a combat feat or teamwork feat for which she meets the prerequisites. Like rage powers she selects in this way, the battle scion can grant this feat to allies under the effect of inspired rage, as long as those allies also meet the prerequisites, but she must expend 2 rounds of raging song for each round in which she grants a combat feat or teamwork feat. If the battle scion gains multiple feats from battle prowess, allies can use these feats to meet the prerequisites for other feats while they're affected by battle prowess (for example, a battle scion with Power Attack and Cleave from battle prowess could grant both, allowing allies with a +1 base attack bonus and a Strength score of 13 to gain both, since they can use Power Attack to qualify for Cleave).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg

,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Wyrm Singer""]]",Skald (Wyrm Singer),Wyrm Singer,<id-00015,12,Breath Weapon,"<p>At 12th level, once per day as a swift action, a wyrm singer can grant a breath weapon attack to himself or an ally affected by his draconic rage raging song. Using the breath weapon is a standard action, and it affects creatures in a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line. The breath weapons deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 skald levels the wyrm singer has, and is of an energy type of the wyrm singer's choice (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). Creatures caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the wyrm singer's skald level + his Charisma modifier) to halve the damage.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg
,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Hunt Caller""]]",Skald (Hunt Caller),Hunt Caller,<id-00030,6,Call of the Wild,"<p>At 6th level, the hunt caller's raging song can transform herself and her allies within 60 feet into animalistic shapes, as per beast shape I (Small animals only) at her caster level. The same transformation applies to all targets. By spending 1 round of raging song per target, the hunt caller can affect any number of allies within 60 feet for 1 hour. When in animal form, the hunt caller is treated as able to speak normally for the purpose of using raging song, but not for using other abilities that require speech (such as spellcasting). The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour; otherwise, its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song per target is expended for that hour.</p><p>At 10th level, the hunt caller can instead choose a Medium animal shape. At 14th level, the hunt caller can choose shapechanger's gift or the effects of beast shape II.

When she does so, she fills the area affected by the channeled energy with light, and can outline creatures in the area of effect as per faerie fire. The sunsinger uses her skald level as her effective cleric level when channeling positive energy. Undead who are particularly harmed by sunlight take a -2 penalty on saving throws against this channeled energy, and take 1 additional point of damage per die of damage dealt by the effect.</p><p>At 11th level, a sunsinger can channel energy twice per day. At 17th level, she can use this ability three times per day.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg
,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Twilight Speaker""]]",Skald (Twilight Speaker),Twilight Speaker,<id-00007,2,Community Domain,"<p>At 2nd level, a twilight speaker gains the Community domain and gains the powers and spells of the domain.

,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Battle Scion""]]",Skald (Battle Scion),Battle Scion,<id-00030,1,Courtly Presence,"<p>At 1st level, a battle scion's bearing radiates command and presence, allowing her to tower over her opponents in social situations. The battle scion adds 1/2 her character level to Intimidate checks, and she starts any verbal duel with an extra edge that she can use for the presence tactic so long as she is not at a significant or extreme disadvantage in the duel. However, her bardic knowledge ability applies to only Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), and Knowledge (nobility).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg
,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Herald of the Horn""]]",Skald (Herald of the Horn),Herald of the Horn,<id-00020,11,Crumbling Blast,"<p>At 11th level, a herald of the horn can use his horn to create a devastating shock wave of energy. Once per day, he can sound a note on the horn that functions like a horn of blasting (DC = 10 + 1/2 the herald of the horn's level + his Charisma bonus). At 17th level, the herald of the horn can use this ability twice per day and it functions like a greater horn of blasting. Unlike an actual horn of blasting, this ability does not carry the risk of destroying the horn. This ability replaces the second and third daily uses of spell kenning gained at 11th and 17th levels.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg
,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Belkzen War Drummer""]]",Skald (Belkzen War Drummer),Belkzen War Drummer,<id-00006,1,Deadly Rhythm,"<p>At 1st level, during his raging song, a Belkzen war drummer can draw clubs and greatclubs as a free action as if he had the Quick Draw feat.

,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Bekyar Demon Dancer""]]",Skald (Bekyar Demon Dancer),Bekyar Demon Dancer,<id-00014,7,Demonic Conquest,"<p>At 7th level, the Bekyar demon dancer's dances warp the minds of those who accept them even further. Whenever anyone affected by his inspired rage makes an attack against a creature, the urge to dominate this foe rises within the affected ally. The ally can attempt to resist this urge with a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the skald's class level + his Charisma modifier). If she fails the save or chooses not to attempt one, the Strength and Constitution bonuses of the demon dancer's inspire rage increase by 2, and she must continue to attack the same target each round. Once the target is defeated, she must burn or cut the symbol of a demon the Bekyar demon dancer worships into the target's flesh, which is a full-round action. The need to conquer and brand foes ends after this action or after the demon dancer stops performing, whichever comes first.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg
,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Twilight Speaker""]]",Skald (Twilight Speaker),Twilight Speaker,<id-00030,1,Devout,"<p>A twilight speaker must worship the elven goddess Findeladlara, and his alignment must be within one step of chaotic good.

This ability acts as inspired rage, except those affected gain a +2 morale bonus on melee attack and damage rolls and a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against paralysis and sleep effects (but they still take a -1 penalty to their AC), rather than inspired rage's normal bonuses. At 4th level and every 4 skald levels thereafter, the song's bonuses on saves against paralysis and sleep effects increase by 1. At 8th and 16th levels, the song's bonus on melee attack and damage rolls increases by 1.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg
,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Bacchanal""]]",Skald (Bacchanal),Bacchanal,<id-00007,2,Drunken Dancer,"<p>At 2nd level, while maintaining a raging song, a bacchanal can consume a berry affected by goodberry, a potion, or a serving of alcohol as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A berry affected by goodberry or a potion has its normal effect, while an alcoholic drink or a berry affected by goodberry via fermented fruit (see above) allows the skald to maintain his raging song that round without expending a round of raging song for the day (instead of the normal effects of the alcohol or fermented berry). For each alcoholic drink or fermented berry consumed while raging, the skald is nauseated for 1 round after his raging song ends. The internal fortitude rage power prevents this nauseated condition from occurring.</p><p>At 7th level, when the bacchanal consumes an alcoholic drink or fermented berry while maintaining his rage song, he can gain the benefits of cure light wounds or remove fear (for the duration of the raging song) at his caster level by spending 2 rounds of raging song. At 12th level, the bacchanal can gain the benefits of heroism (for the duration of the raging song) in this manner.

,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Red Tongue""]]",Skald (Red Tongue),Red Tongue,<id-00032,7,Duplicitous Rhetoric,"<p>At 7th level, when a red tongue begins a raging song, he can select a single rogue talent he knows and grant it to all creatures under the inf luence of his inspired rage. If a rogue talent is limited to a certain number of uses per day, each creature affected is limited to a single use and cannot gain additional uses from a raging song for 24 hours, even if the red tongue ends his raging song and starts again.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg
,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Undying Word""]]",Skald (Undying Word),Undying Word,<id-00019,5,Endurance Power,"<p>At 5th level and every 6 skald levels thereafter, an undying word learns an additional rage power that affects him and any allies under the influence of his inspire resilience. This rage power must be selected from the following list: clear mind, energy absorption, energy resistance, flesh wound, greater energy resistance, greater guarded life, guarded life, increased damage reduction, internal fortitude, or superstition. This otherwise functions as the skald's rage powers ability.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg
,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Fated Champion""]]",Skald (Fated Champion),Fated Champion,<id-00030,5,Far Seer,"<p>At 5th level, a fated champion learns a method of spell kenning that is especially suited for divining and understanding the future, but not for directly harming opponents. For the purpose of determining what level spell slot he expends when using spell kenning, the skald treats the spell level of spells that predict the future (such as augury and divination) as one spell level lower (minimum spell level 1st), and treats the spell level of spells that deal damage as one spell level higher. This alters the spell kenning class feature.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg
,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Warlord""]]",Skald (Warlord),Warlord,<id-00019,5,Fear Me,"<p>At 5th level, the warlord can remind his allies that failing him is far more frightening than the opposition. This raging song works like distraction, except that it applies to saving throws against fear effects instead of patterns and figments, and the warlord attempts an Intimidate check with a -10 penalty instead of a Perform check. Additionally, the warlord's allies can use the warlord's Intimidate check result (with the -10 penalty) as the DC for attempts to demoralize them using Intimidate.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg
,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Dragon Skald""]]",Skald (Dragon Skald),Dragon Skald,<id-00011,2,Fearless Raider,"<p>At 2nd level, the dragon skald becomes resistant to fear effects.

,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Bacchanal""]]",Skald (Bacchanal),Bacchanal,<id-00006,1,Fermented Fruit,"<p>A bacchanal adds goodberry to his list of 1st-level skald spells known. In addition, he can cast it as a spell-like ability once per day. When he casts goodberry as a spell or spell-like ability, the targeted berries ferment; this causes each berry to act as a serving of an alcoholic beverage. A creature that eats a fermented berry does not gain a meal's nourishment, but it is cured of 1 point of damage and becomes slightly foolhardy as if tipsy, gaining a +1 bonus on saves against fear effects for 1 minute after eating the berry.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg
,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Bekyar Demon Dancer""]]",Skald (Bekyar Demon Dancer),Bekyar Demon Dancer,<id-00012,3,Fiendish Maw,"<p>At 3rd level, whenever a Bekyar demon dancer inspires rage, all who accept his rage gain a bite attack dealing 1d6 points of damage (for Medium allies; 1d4 points of damage if Small). This damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small) at 7th level, to 2d6 (1d8 if Small) at 12th level, and to 3d6 (2d6 if Small) at 17th level. These increases effectively treat the affected creatures as though their sizes had increased by one size category, and so don't stack with any similar damage increases (such as the increase from the strong jawAPG spell) other than those due to an actual increase in size. If used as part of a full attack action, the bite attack is made at the creature's full base attack bonus - 5. This ability replaces the rage power gained at 3rd level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg

,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""War Painter""]]",Skald (War Painter),War Painter,<id-00030,1,Furious Paint,"<p>By spending 10 minutes preparing and applying special paints to his or an ally's skin, a war painter can create patterns that store the effects of one of his raging songs. The war painter must expend 1 or more rounds of his raging song class ability while anointing the ally, and the paint retains its potency until the war painter recovers his daily uses of raging song. The ally can activate the paint as a move action, gaining the benefits of the raging song, including any rage powers as appropriate. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the rounds of raging song the war painter expended + the war painter's ranks in Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos)-but no more than double the number of rounds of raging song expended. By halving the remaining number of rounds of raging song, an ally can suspend the paint's effects as a free action and activate the paint again later as a move action.</p><p>A war painter cab apply the effects of any feats that affect bardic performance to his furious paint, except effects that extend the effects of performances, such as the Lingering Song feat.

The effect ends when the target can no longer hear the bacchanal from within 30 feet. As an immediate action, an ally of the bacchanal within 30 feet can dance along as a full-round action (taking all penalties except the confused condition for that round) to allow the bacchanal to target an additional creature.

,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""War Painter""]]",Skald (War Painter),War Painter,<id-00019,5,Thousand Totems,"<p>At 5th level, a war painter can channel a powerful totem into his furious paints while applying the pigments on an ally. This grants the painted ally the benefits of one additional rage power when the ally activates the furious paints. The war painter does not need to know the rage power, but it must be one for which he qualifies. Furthermore, the war painter can select only a blood rage power (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 80) or a totem rage power (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 74). If the war painter already has a different blood rage or totem rage power that would be applied to the painted ally, this new rage power replaces it and any other rage powers that require it as a prerequisite.</p><p>A war painter can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and he gains one additional use at 11th and 17th levels. He can apply this ability multiple times to the same creature, though only to give it rage powers that use the granted rage power as a prerequisite (such as beast totem and greater beast totem).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg

Once selected, this choice cannot be changed. This animal becomes the skald's personal totem animal and influences his later abilities. He gains the following rage power.</p><p><i>Song of the Beast (Su): </i>The totemic skald grants the animal focus abilities of his totem animal (as the hunter's animal focus ability) to all allies affected by his raging song. He treats his skald level as his hunter level for determining the abilities of the animal focus (such as the improvements gained at 8th and 15th level). This ability replaces the rage power gained at 3rd level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg
,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Totemic Skald""]]",Skald (Totemic Skald),Totemic Skald,<id-00018,4,Totem Empathy,"<p>At 4th level, the totemic skald can improve the attitude of animals of the same type as his totem. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The skald rolls 1d20 and adds his skald level and his Charisma modif ier to determine the totem empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p><p>In addition, at 4th level, the totemic skald can cast charm animal once per day as a spell-like ability, using his skald level as his caster level and his Charisma modif ier to determine the DC. This only functions against animals that are of the same type as his totem animal (subject to GM discretion). At 8th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, he can use this ability one additional time per day.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg
,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Totem Channeler""]]",Skald (Totem Channeler),Totem Channeler,<id-00002,1,Totemic Versatility,"<p>When a totem channeler learns a new rage power, he can select from more than one group of totem rage powers, even though he normally could not do so. Totem rage powers grant benefits related to a theme, are organized in groups of three, and usually have the word 'totem' in their name. When the totem channeler starts an inspired rage raging song, he can add totem rage powers from only one group at a time. He can change the group of added totem rage powers by ending the current inspired rage and starting a new one.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg
,Skald,"[[""Skald""],[""Totem Channeler""]]",Skald (Totem Channeler),Totem Channeler,<id-00027,9,Totem's Guidance,"<p>At 9th level, the totem channeler can draw strength and protection from his totem powers when he wades into battle with song on his lips. When he adds a totem rage power to his inspired rage, he and his allies gain a +1 insight bonus to AC and on saving throws for the duration of the totem channeler's raging song. At 14th level, this bonus increases to +2. This bonus applies only to the first totem rage power he applies to his inspired rage.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg

At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p><p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard's bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p><p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p><p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally's turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald's allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song's effects last for that ally's turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p><p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p><p><i>Inspire Resilience (Su): </i>At 1st level, the undying word can grant his companions supernatural endurance. This functions as inspired rage, but it grants neither a bonus to his allies' Strength nor a -1 penalty to their AC.</p><p>This raging song replaces inspired rage.</p><p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p><p><i>Song of Defiance (Su): </i>At 6th level, an undying word can shield his allies against the environment. By expending 1 round of raging song, the undying word grants all allies within 60 feet the effects of endure elements for the next hour. The undying word must continue to perform for the remainder of the hour; otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p><p>This raging song replaces song of strength.</p><p><i>Dirge of Determination (Su): </i>At 10th level, an undying word can urge his allies within 30 feet to overcome hardships. Affected allies treat ability damage, ability drain, and penalties to ability scores as though each were 2 lower. This reduction increases to 4 at 15th level, and to 6 at 20th level. The undying word can never reduce a penalty below 0 or increase an ability score beyond its original value in this manner.</p><p>This raging song replaces dirge of doom.</p><p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg

Its associated skills are Acrobatics and Fly. This ability alters versatile performance.</p><p>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill's bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p><p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horn-drinking.jpg

His effective druid level for this ability is equal to his skald level - 1. He can use this ability twice per day at 11th level, and three times per day at 17th level. This doesn't allow the skald to assume other forms, such as elementals, plants, or other kinds of animals.</p><p>When in animal form, the skald is treated as able to speak normally for the purpose of using raging song, but not for using other abilities that require speech (such as spellcasting).
