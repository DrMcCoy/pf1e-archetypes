Shifter,"[[""Shifter""],[""Elementalist Shifter""]]",Shifter (Elementalist Shifter),Elementalist Shifter,<id-00020,9,Omnielementalist,"<p>At 9th level, an elementalist shifter can fuse two elemental forms together, gaining combined powers of the different aspects and manifesting them in ways that bring to mind powerful natural weather phenomena. When the elementalist shifter takes on one minor form each from two of her elemental aspects, she gains an additional ability as long as she maintains the form. The effects of the abilities depend on the elemental combination, as detailed below.</p><p>Ash Storm (Su): By combining air and fire, the elementalist shifter surrounds herself with a storm of swirling ash, granting her a 20% miss chance against ranged attacks.</p><p>Downpour (Su): The elementalist shifter combines the powers of air and water to generate a torrential downpour in her square and squares adjacent to her. This rain automatically extinguishes all nonmagical fires in her square and squares adjacent to her (including flames on creatures that have caught on fire). It also has a chance to extinguish ongoing magical fire (but not instantaneous magical fire effects such as fireball) within or that enters the area, as if the elementalist shifter had cast dispel magic, using her elementalist shifter level as her caster level for the effect.</p><p>Mudslide (Su): Combining the elements of earth and water causes the elementalist shifter to generate an aura of mud. This mud extends out to all squares adjacent to her and counts as difficult terrain; it moves with her and vanishes when she ends her elemental aspect.</p><p>Sandstorm (Su): Combining the high winds of air and fine particulates of earth produces a sandstorm that extends out to a radius of 20 feet from the elementalist shifter. All light levels in the area diminish by one step, and creatures caught in the effect take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each round they remain within the sandstorm.</p><p>Steam Cloud (Su) When the elementalist shifter enters a minor form of fire and water at the same time, the heat of fire and moisture of water generate an explosive area of steam around her out to a radius of 20 feet as per obscuring mist. The mist remains in place until she ends her elemental aspect; it doesn't move with her.</p><p>Volcanic Stride (Su): By combining earth and fire, the elementalist shifter can damage the ground around herself. As a standard action, she can deform a region of natural or artificial rock in her space, turning it into difficult terrain and causing creatures that pass through it to take an amount of fire damage equal to that dealt by her elemental strike with no save. Affected terrain remains transformed until the shifter ends her elemental aspect.</p>",icons/commodities/biological/hand-clawed-scale-grey.webp
