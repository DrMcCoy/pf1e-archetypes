Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Soul Warden""]]",Spiritualist (Soul Warden),Soul Warden,<id-00025,20,Algea Call,"<p>At 20th level, as a standard action once per hour, a soul warden's nosoi scribe can summon countless other nosoi, which flock together to form an algea. This transformation lasts for 1 minute, after which the nosoi scribe returns unharmed, unless the algea is brought to 0 hit points or killed, in which case the nosoi scribe returns unconscious at 0 hit points. This is a summoning effect.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Totem Spiritualist""]]",Spiritualist (Totem Spiritualist),Totem Spiritualist,<id-00019,9,Animal Senses,"<p>At 9th level, a totem spiritualist shares her phantom animal's senses. If her phantom animal has any of the following abilities, she gains them whenever the phantom animal is harbored in her consciousness: blindsense, darkvision, low-light vision, and scent.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Priest of the Fallen""]]",Spiritualist (Priest of the Fallen),Priest of the Fallen,<id-00008,3,Channel Energy,"<p>At 3rd level, a priest of the fallen can channel her phantom's divine energy. This functions as the cleric's channel energy class feature, except that the amount of damage dealt or hit points restored is equal to 1d6 points plus an additional 1d6 points for every 2 spiritualist levels beyond 3rd. The priest of the fallen decides to channel positive or negative energy based on her alignment. A neutral priest of the fallen can channel either positive or negative energy, but once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Necrologist""]]",Spiritualist (Necrologist),Necrologist,<id-00009,4,Channel Energy,"<p>At 4th level, a necrologist gains the ability to channel negative energy, with an effective cleric level equal to her spiritualist level - 3. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Hag-Haunted""]]",Spiritualist (Hag-Haunted),Hag-Haunted,<id-00009,4,Death Curse,"<p>A hag phantom is partially animated by the power of a hag's dying curse, and at 4th level this grants her a death curse of her own. As an immediate action, whenever the hag phantom is slain and returned to the Ethereal Plane, the phantom can utter a curse on the creature that killed her, targeting it with bestow curse. At 6th level, the spiritualist gains bestow curse as an extra 3rd-level spell known. At 16th level, the spiritualist gains major curse as an additional 6th-level spell known.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Ectoplasmatist""]]",Spiritualist (Ectoplasmatist),Ectoplasmatist,<id-00010,5,Detect Undead,"<p>At 5th level, a spiritualist's connection with the Ethereal Plane becomes so strong that she can use detect undead at will as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to her spiritualist level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Plague Eater""]]",Spiritualist (Plague Eater),Plague Eater,<id-00015,7,Disfiguring Touch,"<p>At 7th level, a plague eater can inflict upon others the superficial disfigurement associated with plague by casting disfiguring touch as a spell-like ability once per day. At 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the spiritualist can use this ability an additional time per day (to a maximum of four times per day at 19th level).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Usher of Lost Souls""]]",Spiritualist (Usher of Lost Souls),Usher of Lost Souls,<id-00009,5,Disrupting Phantom,"<p>When an usher of lost souls reaches 4th level, her phantom gains the ability to directly harm haunts. The phantom can make an attack while within a haunt's area against an AC equal to 10 + the haunt's caster level. On a hit, the phantom deals its slam damage to the haunt; the haunt is immune to critical hits from the phantom. When an usher of lost souls reaches 12th level, her phantom can deal critical hits to a haunt, and the critical threat range for its slam attacks against haunts increases to 19-20.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Usher of Lost Souls""]]",Spiritualist (Usher of Lost Souls),Usher of Lost Souls,<id-00022,14,Disruptive Influence,"<p>At 14th level, the usher of lost souls can put spirits to rest. She can use one of her uses of calm spiritOA to instead cast purge spiritOA as a spell-like ability. She can expend two uses of her etheric channel to cast either of these spells as a spell-like ability.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Involutionist""]]",Spiritualist (Involutionist),Involutionist,<id-00026,1,Divine Spellcasting,"<p>An involutionist is a divine spellcaster. Her spells use verbal components instead of thought components and somatic components instead of emotional components. An involutionist's spirit phantom is her conduit to the divine, and it serves as her divine focus; the involutionist must either be within 5 feet on her spirit phantom or absorb her phantom into her consciousness to cast spells that require a divine focus.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Onmyoji""]]",Spiritualist (Onmyoji),Onmyoji,<id-00020,1,Divine Spellcasting,"<p>An onmyoji's spellcasting ability comes from divine rather than psychic power. As a divine caster, the onmyoji's spells use verbal components instead of thought components, and somatic components instead of emotional components, and she uses an ofuda as a divine focus. Ofudas are scrolls with holy writings written on parchment, cloth, or wood (having the same cost as a wooden holy symbol) or metal (having the same cost as a silver holy symbol). This ability alters spellcasting.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Onmyoji""]]",Spiritualist (Onmyoji),Onmyoji,<id-00009,4,Divine Teachings,"<p>An onmyoji gains the ability to call upon her phantom to help her cast spells she normally couldn't. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, an onmyoji can choose a single spell from the cleric spell list with a spell level she is currently able to cast, and add that spell to her list of spells known, at the same spell level as it appears on the cleric spell list. Because the onmyoji relies on her phantom's influence in order to cast these spells, she can cast spells added in this way only while the phantom is confined within her consciousness (not stranded on the Ethereal Plane or fully manifested). This ability replaces spiritual interference and greater spiritual interference.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Drowned Channeler""]]",Spiritualist (Drowned Channeler),Drowned Channeler,<id-00026,1,Drowned Phantom,"<p>A drowned channeler has a drowned phantom. A drowned phantom's ectoplasmic body drips with water and seems to bleed off watery droplets even its incorporeal form. A drowned phantom gains a swim speed of 30 feet in both forms and gains the water subtype in addition to the phantom subtype, meaning that it can use its natural slam attacks underwater without taking the penalty for bludgeoning attacks underwater. The drowned channeler's etheric tether extends twice as far underwater, but only half as far above water. Additionally, the drowned phantom doesn't grant any of the usual benefits while confined in the drowned channeler's consciousness unless the drowned channeler is within 25 feet of an ocean, sea, lake, or other large body of water. Both forms of bonded manifestation grant the drowned phantom's swim speed of 30 feet to the drowned channeler, and attacks from the ectoplasmic bonded manifestation's tendrils don't take the typical penalties for bludgeoning attacks underwater, as if the phantom itself made them.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Drowned Channeler""]]",Spiritualist (Drowned Channeler),Drowned Channeler,<id-00010,5,Drowned Powers,"<p>At 5th level, a drowned channeler can use hydraulic pushAPG as a spell-like ability once per day, with an additional use each day at 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter. At 7th level, she can use slipstreamAPG once per day as a spell-like ability, with an additional use each day at 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter. At 9th level, she can use ride the wavesUM once per day as a spell-like ability. Finally, at 16th level, she can use fluid formAPG once per day as a spell-like ability.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Drowned Channeler""]]",Spiritualist (Drowned Channeler),Drowned Channeler,<id-00007,2,Drowned Spells,"<p>At 2nd level, a drowned channeler adds control water, fluid formAPG, hydraulic pushAPG, hydraulic torrentAPG, life current*, pressure adaptation*, ride the wavesUM, slipstreamAPG, stabilize pressure*, unlife current*, water breathing, and wave form* to the spiritualist spell list at the same spell level as they appear on the cleric list or sorcerer/wizard list, whichever is lower. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) appear in the Aquatic Spells section of this book (see page 59). The drowned channeler must still select them as spells known as normal.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Seeker of Enlightenment""]]",Spiritualist (Seeker of Enlightenment),Seeker of Enlightenment,<id-00005,1,Echoes of Expertise,"<p>A seeker of enlightenment gains a bonus equal to her spiritualist level on checks attempted with the two skills determined by her phantom's emotional focus. When the phantom is confined to the seeker of enlightenment's consciousness, it grants a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects; at 12th level, this bonus increases to +4. Once per day as a free action, the seeker of enlightenment can attempt a check with any Knowledge skill, including one in which she is not trained, and add her spiritualist level as a bonus on the check.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Seeker of Enlightenment""]]",Spiritualist (Seeker of Enlightenment),Seeker of Enlightenment,<id-00020,10,Echoes of Mastery,"<p>At 10th level, a seeker of enlightenment gains the bonus on saving throws from echoes of expertise even when her phantom is manifested. Additionally, once per day, she can take 20 on any Knowledge check, including one in which she is not trained.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Ectoplasmatist""]]",Spiritualist (Ectoplasmatist),Ectoplasmatist,<id-00009,4,Ectoplasmic Armor,"<p>At 4th level when an ectoplasmatist manifests her spiritual lash ability, tendrils of ectoplasmic material envelop her body, granting her a +4 armor bonus to AC.</p><p>At 12th level, the ectoplasmatist's armor bonus to AC increases to +6 and is treated as ghost touch armor.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Scourge""]]",Spiritualist (Scourge),Scourge,<id-00021,12,Ectoplasmic Swarm,"<p>At 12th level, as a standard action, a scourge with a phantom manifested in ectoplasmic form can command it to break apart in a gruesome display of gore and agony, transforming it into a swarm of Diminutive ectoplasmic organs and viscera. The phantom gains the swarm subtype, dealing its unmodified slam damage die as damage for its swarm attack. Its distraction DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier. In this form, the phantom is too diffuse to use inflict painOA or any of its abilities from emotional focus (even passive abilities).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Fractured Mind""]]",Spiritualist (Fractured Mind),Fractured Mind,<id-00027,1,Emotional Power,"<p>The fractured mind gains a number of spell-like abilities, which are tied to her phantom's emotional focus. She gains one spell-like ability at 5th level, a second at 7th level, a third at 9th level, and a fourth at 16th level. A fractured mind can use each of these abilities once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 spiritualist levels she possesses beyond the level at which she gained the spell-like ability. The saving throw DCs for these spell-like abilities are equal to 10 + 1/2 the fractured mind's spiritualist class level + the fractured mind's Charisma modifier, rather than being based on the spell's level. The spell-like abilities granted by each emotional focus are listed below.</p><p><i>Anger: </i>Enlarge person (5th), rage (7th), longstrider (9th), shout (16th).</p><p><i>Dedication: </i>Command (5th), spiritual weapon (7th), bless (9th), death ward (16th).</p><p><i>Despair: </i>BungleUM (5th), stricken heartACG (7th), doom (9th), crushing despair (16th).</p><p><i>Fear: </i>Bane (5th), mad hallucinationUM (7th), doom (9th), phantasmal killer (16th).</p><p><i>Hatred: </i>Doom (5th), inflict moderate wounds (7th), bane (9th), bestow curse (16th).</p><p><i>Jealousy: </i>Sanctuary (5th), resist energy (7th), entropic shield (9th), spell immunity (16th).</p><p><i>Zeal: </i>Bless (5th), spiritual weapon (7th), divine favor (9th), freedom of movement (16th).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Fractured Mind""]]",Spiritualist (Fractured Mind),Fractured Mind,<id-00026,1,Emotional Spellcasting,"<p>A fractured mind's ability to cast spells is tied to the force of her own spirit rather than her connection to the spirit world. As a result, she uses her Charisma score rather than her Wisdom score to determine the highest spell level she can cast, the saving throw DCs of spells she casts, and her bonus spells per day. This ability alters spellcasting.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Geist Channeler""]]",Spiritualist (Geist Channeler),Geist Channeler,<id-00027,1,Emotionless,"<p>A geist channeler's phantom doesn't have an emotional focus; instead, it is cold and devoid of emotions. The phantom gains a number of ranks in Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (religion) equal to its Hit Dice. While confined in the geist channeler's consciousness, the phantom grants the geist channeler Skill Focus in each of these skills. The phantom has good Reflex and Will saves, and gains Iron Will as a bonus feat, as well as the following abilities.</p><p><i>Unnerving Touch (Su): </i>As a standard action, a geist channeler's phantom can make a melee touch attack against a living creature, even if that creature is corporeal. If the attack hits, the target is shaken for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) negates this effect. At 5th level, when the phantom can damage corporeal creatures with its slam attack, its slam attacks against living corporeal creatures gain this ability. Multiple attacks against the same creature don't cause the creature to become frightened. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p><p><i>Poltergeist's Knack (Sp): </i>At 7th level, a geist channeler's phantom can use telekinesis as a spell-like ability. It can use only the sustained force and violent thrust versions of this spell. The phantom can use this ability three times per day, plus one additional time at 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter (maximum seven times per day at 19th level). Its caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to the phantom's Hit Dice.</p><p><i>Spectral Protection (Su): </i>At 12th level as a standard action, while a geist channeler's phantom is confined within his psyche, he can call upon its power to project an aura of spectral energy that prevents incorporeal creatures from approaching him. This takes the form of a 30-foot-radius emanation centered on the geist channeler. Any incorporeal creature attempting to enter this area must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the geist channeler's spiritualist class level + the geist channeler's Wisdom modifier) or be unable to do so. This ability can be used only defensively, not aggressively; forcing the aura against an incorporeal creature collapses the aura. The geist channeler can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his spiritualist level. The minutes don't need to be continuous, but must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p><p><i>Malevolent Possession (Sp): </i>At 17th level, a geist channeler's phantom can invade the bodies of other creatures. This functions as possession (see page 181). To use this ability, the phantom must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier). The phantom can use this ability once per day.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Shadow Caller""]]",Spiritualist (Shadow Caller),Shadow Caller,<id-00028,1,Emotionless,"<p>A shadow caller's shade lacks an emotional focus; it is cold and devoid of all emotions. The shade gains a number of ranks in Intimidate and Stealth equal to its Hit Dice. The shadow caller gains Skill Focus in each of these skills while the shade inhabits her shadow. The shade has good Reflex and Will saves, gains Lightning Reflexes as a bonus feat, and gains the following abilities.</p><p>Weakening Touch (Su): A shade's slam attack causes its victim to take a -2 penalty to Strength for 1 round. As a standard action, a shade in incorporeal form can deliver the penalty as a touch attack. This penalty does not stack with itself. This is a negative energy effect.</p><p>Umbral Shroud (Su) When the shadow caller reaches 7th level, her shade can emit a 10-foot aura of swirling shadows that grants all allies 20% concealment against creatures without darkvision or the see in darkness ability, and a +4 bonus on Stealth checks.</p><p>Shadow Caster (Sp): When the shadow caller reaches 12th level, her shade gains the ability to cast either shadow conjuration or shadow evocation once per day. It uses its Hit Dice as its caster level, and the DC for these spells equals 10 + 1/2 the shade's Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier. Instead of the normal spell level and percentage of reality for the two spells, the maximum spell level of the duplicated spell is 4th level, and the effects are 40% real. When the shadow caller reaches 18th level, the maximum spell level improves to 6th level and effects are 60% real.</p><p>Midnight Shroud (Su): When the shadow caller reaches 17th level, her shade's umbral shroud also lowers the light level in its range to darkness, regardless of the prevailing conditions; this counts as a 7th-level darkness spell for the purpose of adjudicating light and darkness effects.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Scourge""]]",Spiritualist (Scourge),Scourge,<id-00026,6,Endure Torment,"<p>At 6th level, a scourge's phantom gains immunity to pain effects and gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against effects that could cause it to become staggered or stunned.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Usher of Lost Souls""]]",Spiritualist (Usher of Lost Souls),Usher of Lost Souls,<id-00026,1,Etheric Channel,"<p>An usher of lost souls can focus ethereal energies to channel waves of disruption. The spiritualist can channel positive energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). She channels energy like a cleric of her spiritualist level, except the channeled energy can be used only to harm undead or haunts. This otherwise functions as channel energy for the purposes of feats and abilities. The spiritualist does not require a holy symbol to use this ability.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Phantom Blade""]]",Spiritualist (Phantom Blade),Phantom Blade,<id-00009,4,Etheric Focus,"<p>At 4th level, the phantom blade can use her phantom weapon to aid her in casting spells with thought components. She can center herself (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 144) as a swift action. At 12th level, the spiritualist can center herself as a free action.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Exciter""]]",Spiritualist (Exciter),Exciter,<id-00007,2,Excitation,"<p>At 2nd level, when an exciter is in a rapture, each round he can choose to intensify his emotional fury, expending 2 rounds of rapture instead of 1. When he uses excitation, he chooses one of the two abilities that his emotional focus would normally grant to a manifested phantom, such as strength focus and powerful strike for an anger phantom, or power from despair and miserable strike for a despair phantom. He gains these abilities until the beginning of his next turn. If the ability normally augments only a phantom's slam attacks, it instead applies to the ectoplasmic tendrils that the spiritualist can sprout using his ectoplasmic bonded manifestation.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Quintessentialist""]]",Spiritualist (Quintessentialist),Quintessentialist,<id-00027,1,Exemplar,"<p>Instead of bonding to the phantom of a dead soul, a quintessentialist forges her best qualities into a spiritual aspect called an exemplar, which resides in her subconscious mind at all times rather than on the Ethereal Plane. An exemplar uses the quintessentialist's ability scores when fully manifested rather than those of a standard phantom, but otherwise advances as a phantom. The exemplar can cast any of the spiritualist's spells while fully manifested, sharing the same spells known and spell slots, and does not suffer from the quintessentialist's unfocused spellcasting ability.</p><p>A quintessentialist can fully manifest her exemplar as a full-round action rather than a 1-minute ritual, and she can dismiss it back into her mind as a standard action. When fully manifested, a quintessentialist can transfer any equipment she is currently wearing or carrying to her exemplar, allowing it to manifest with weapons, armor, and other equipment, but doing so removes these possessions from the quintessentialist. She can likewise grant her exemplar any feats she knows, losing access to those feats herself while the exemplar remains fully manifested. Projecting an exemplar is draining, however. A quintessentialist cannot cast any spells herself and she takes a -2 penalty to all ability scores while her exemplar is fully manifested. Every round the exemplar remains fully manifested, the quintessentialist takes 1d6 points of damage; this damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any way.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Exciter""]]",Spiritualist (Exciter),Exciter,<id-00006,1,Fast Movement,"<p>An exciter's land speed is faster than normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor and is not carrying a heavy load. This doesn't stack with the barbarian ability of the same name.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Plague Eater""]]",Spiritualist (Plague Eater),Plague Eater,<id-00020,10,Fused Well-Being,"<p>At 10th level, a plague eater always gains the benefits of bonded senses when her phantom is manifested. She also gains the skill ranks and bonus to resist disease granted by the spirit's emotional focus, even when her phantom is manifested.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Geist Channeler""]]",Spiritualist (Geist Channeler),Geist Channeler,<id-00028,1,Geistform Phantom,"<p>A geist channeler's phantom can't manifest in ectoplasmic form, and is limited to manifesting in incorporeal form. As a result, the phantom has no Strength score, and has a starting Wisdom score of 12. Instead of gaining two slam attacks, it gains only a single slam attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. The slam attack's damage increases to 1d10 points at 5th level, to 2d6 at 10th level, to 2d8 at 15th level, and 2d10 at 20th level (assuming the phantom is Medium). The phantom does not gain the magic attacks ability at 4th level.</p><p>While manifested incorporeally, a geist channeler's phantom can attack only other incorporeal creatures. Because the phantom is incorporeal, the damage it deals to such creatures is not reduced as a result of them being incorporeal. At 5th level, the phantom can take a swift action to infuse itself with trace amounts of ectoplasm so it can attack corporeal creatures for 1 round. During that time, it deals half damage to corporeal creatures with its slam, and corporeal creatures with nonmagical weapons deal half damage to the phantom. At 10th level, when the phantom infuses itself, its attacks deal normal damage to corporeal creatures.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Exciter""]]",Spiritualist (Exciter),Exciter,<id-00021,12,Greater Rapture,"<p>At 12th level, an exciter increases the morale bonus his rapture grants to each applicable ability score by 2 and the morale bonus he gains on Will saves by 1. In addition, upon entering a rapture, he can apply the effects of a single spiritualist spell he knows with an emotion component to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal, and it must be a 1st- or 2nd-level spell. For every 3 spiritualist levels he has beyond 12th, the maximum spell level of this spell increases by 1. If he uses this ability to apply the effects of a spell again before the duration of the previous spell expires, the previous spell ends immediately.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Plague Eater""]]",Spiritualist (Plague Eater),Plague Eater,<id-00028,12,Greater Spiritual Inoculation,"<p>At 12th level, the plague eater becomes immune to disease, including supernatural and magical diseases. In addition, whenever a manifested phantom is in ectoplasmic form, each of the plague eater's allies within the phantom's reach gains a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against disease.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Grim Apostle""]]",Spiritualist (Grim Apostle),Grim Apostle,<id-00026,1,Grim Phantom,"<p>The spirit linked to a grim apostle functions in all respects as a regular spiritualist's phantom, but each day when the grim apostle regains her daily spell slots, she can choose which Horseman focus (see below) is dominant within the grim phantom.</p><p>When the grim phantom is banished to the Ethereal Plane, the grim apostle takes an amount of damage equal to 1d4 x the grim phantom's number of Hit Dice.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Hag-Haunted""]]",Spiritualist (Hag-Haunted),Hag-Haunted,<id-00026,1,Hag Phantom,"<p>A hag phantom forms from the soul of a deceased hag. She always has an evil alignment, rather than matching the spiritualist's alignment, and must select one of the following emotional focuses: anger, hatred, jealousy, or zeal. The hag phantom starts with a +2 bonus to Strength and Intelligence and has her own agenda-usually contrary to the spiritualist's-though she recognizes that the spiritualist can unmanifest her, and therefore she typically hides suspicious actions from her spiritualist. When in the spiritualist's consciousness, the hag phantom can grant the hag-haunted Spell Focus (necromancy) and Skill Focus (Bluff), but she often revokes them if the spiritualist banishes her there as a punishment, and she might use them as leverage to get what she wants. When the spiritualist reaches 10th level, the hag can also grant these feats while manifested, and when the spiritualist reaches 12th level, she can also grant Greater Spell Focus (necromancy).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Hag-Haunted""]]",Spiritualist (Hag-Haunted),Hag-Haunted,<id-00021,1,Hag Spellcasting,"<p>A hag-haunted spiritualist's spells come from her connection to her hag phantom. Her spells are considered arcane rather than psychic, and they use verbal and somatic components instead of thought and emotion components.

Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Grim Apostle""]]",Spiritualist (Grim Apostle),Grim Apostle,<id-00005,1,Hardened Soul,"<p>At 1st level, while a grim phantom is confined in the grim apostle's consciousness, the grim apostle gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects and effects that would remove or subsume the grim apostle's soul (such as possession or trap the soul). At 6th level and every 6 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 2 (to a maximum of +10 at 18th level).

Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Scourge""]]",Spiritualist (Scourge),Scourge,<id-00015,7,Inflict Pain,"<p>At 7th level, a scourge can use inflict painOA as a spell-like ability once per day, plus one additional use per day for every 4 spiritualist levels beyond 7th. If her phantom is fully manifested, it can also use this ability, though doing so takes the phantom a full-round action, and it still counts against the scourge's daily uses of this ability.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg

When the shade is summoned, the shadow caller does not cast a shadow under any circumstances. Creatures that don't normally cast shadows (such as vampires) cannot be shadow callers. While the shade inhabits its master's shadow, the shadow caller gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks against creatures without darkvision or the see in darkness ability; at 12th level, this bonus increases to +8.

This replaces the phantom's antagonistic ability.</p><p>A spiritualist begins play with the aid of a powerful and versatile spirit entity called a phantom. The phantom forms a link with the spiritualist, who forever after can either harbor the creature within her consciousness or manifest it as an ectoplasmic or incorporeal entity. A phantom has the same alignment as the spiritualist, and it can speak all the languages its master can. A spiritualist can harbor her phantom in her consciousness (see the shared consciousness class feature on page 73), manifest it partially (see the bonded manifestation class feature on page 74), or fully manifest it. A fully manifested phantom is treated as a summoned creature from the Ethereal Plane, except it is not sent back to the Ethereal Plane until it is reduced to a negative amount of hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score.</p><p>A spiritualist can fully manifest her phantom through a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When the phantom is fully manifested, the spiritualist can change the form of the phantom's manifestation (either from ectoplasmic to incorporeal or vice versa) as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. When the phantom manifests, its hit points are unchanged from the last time it manifested, unless the phantom was slain and returned to the Ethereal Plane; in this case, the phantom manifests with half its maximum number of hit points. The phantom does not heal naturally, and can be healed only with magic or by being tended to with the Heal skill while fully manifested in ectoplasmic form. The phantom stays fully manifested until it is either returned to the spiritualist's consciousness (a standard action) or banished to the Ethereal Plane. If the phantom is banished to the Ethereal Plane, it can't return to the spiritualist's consciousness or manifest again for 24 hours.</p><p>While fully manifested, a phantom can't be returned to the Ethereal Plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment work normally. Whenever the spiritualist is unconscious or asleep, the phantom immediately returns to the spiritualist's consciousness. If the spiritualist dies, the phantom is returned to the Ethereal Plane, and can't return to the spiritualist's consciousness until 24 hours after the spiritualist is brought back to life. A phantom can't be dismissed or banished (by a spell or any other similar effect) while it resides in the spiritualist's consciousness, as the phantom is protected from such effects by the power of the spiritualist's psyche.</p><p>Fully manifested phantoms can wear armor and use items (though not wield weapons) appropriate to their forms. Any items worn, carried, or held by a phantom are dropped when the phantom returns to the spiritualist's consciousness, and must be retrieved and donned anew if the phantom wishes to use them when it fully manifests in the future.</p><p>Phantoms are self-involved, even jealous, creatures that do not play well with other summoned companions. A phantom refuses to manifest (either fully or as part of a bonded manifestation; see Bonded Manifestation on page 74) in the presence of an eidolon or shadow summoned by the phantom's master. Furthermore, if a phantom is manifested when such a creature is summoned, it immediately retreats into its spiritualist's consciousness, and will not manifest again until the eidolon or shadow is dismissed.</p><p>A fully manifested phantom's abilities, feats, Hit Dice, saving throws, and skills are tied to the spiritualist's class level and increase as the spiritualist gains levels.

The phantom animal uses the statistics of an animal companion and follows the standard animal companion progression in regard to Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throws, skills, feats, natural armor bonus, Strength and Dexterity bonuses, and bonus tricks, but not its special abilities. A phantom animal instead gains the special abilities of a standard phantom listed in the table on page 77 of Occult Adventures. A phantom animal is capable of becoming harbored in the spiritualist's consciousness or becoming fully or partially manifested. A phantom animal is otherwise considered a phantom for the purposes of all feats and abilities.</p><p>At 7th level and every 5 spiritualist levels thereafter, the totem spiritualist can choose to gain an additional phantom animal. This additional phantom animal uses the appropriate statistics for a phantom animal of its level. A totem spiritualist can have only one active phantom animal at a time. Dismissing an active phantom animal to call another requires a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform.</p><p>Instead of gaining an additional phantom animal, the totem spiritualist can choose to empower a phantom animal with which she is already bonded. The first time the phantom animal is empowered, it gains two bonus tricks. The second time it is empowered, the phantom animal gains the hunter's animal focus class ability (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 27), treating the totem spiritualist's spiritualist level as her effective hunter level. The third time it is empowered, the damage dice of the phantom animal's natural attacks increase by one step.</p><p>A totem spiritualist can release a phantom animal from her service much like a druid releases an animal companion. If a totem spiritualist releases a phantom animal from service, she can gain a new one by performing a ritual requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of meditation in an environment where the animal that the phantom resembles typically lives.</p><p>A totem spiritualist treats any druid levels she has as effective spiritualist levels to determine the abilities of her phantom animals, but does not treat her spiritualist levels as effective druid levels to determine the abilities of animal companions.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg

A drowned phantom's ectoplasmic body drips with water and seems to bleed off watery droplets even its incorporeal form. A drowned phantom gains a swim speed of 30 feet in both forms and gains the water subtype in addition to the phantom subtype, meaning that it can use its natural slam attacks underwater without taking the penalty for bludgeoning attacks underwater. The drowned channeler's etheric tether extends twice as far underwater, but only half as far above water. Additionally, the drowned phantom doesn't grant any of the usual benefits while confined in the drowned channeler's consciousness unless the drowned channeler is within 25 feet of an ocean, sea, lake, or other large body of water. Both forms of bonded manifestation grant the drowned phantom's swim speed of 30 feet to the drowned channeler, and attacks from the ectoplasmic bonded manifestation's tendrils don't take the typical penalties for bludgeoning attacks underwater, as if the phantom itself made them.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg

The phantom gains a number of ranks in Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (religion) equal to its Hit Dice. While confined in the geist channeler's consciousness, the phantom grants the geist channeler Skill Focus in each of these skills. The phantom has good Reflex and Will saves, and gains Iron Will as a bonus feat, as well as the following abilities.</p><p><i>Unnerving Touch (Su): </i>As a standard action, a geist channeler's phantom can make a melee touch attack against a living creature, even if that creature is corporeal. If the attack hits, the target is shaken for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) negates this effect. At 5th level, when the phantom can damage corporeal creatures with its slam attack, its slam attacks against living corporeal creatures gain this ability. Multiple attacks against the same creature don't cause the creature to become frightened. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p><p><i>Poltergeist's Knack (Sp): </i>At 7th level, a geist channeler's phantom can use telekinesis as a spell-like ability. It can use only the sustained force and violent thrust versions of this spell. The phantom can use this ability three times per day, plus one additional time at 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter (maximum seven times per day at 19th level). Its caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to the phantom's Hit Dice.</p><p><i>Spectral Protection (Su): </i>At 12th level as a standard action, while a geist channeler's phantom is confined within his psyche, he can call upon its power to project an aura of spectral energy that prevents incorporeal creatures from approaching him. This takes the form of a 30-foot-radius emanation centered on the geist channeler. Any incorporeal creature attempting to enter this area must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the geist channeler's spiritualist class level + the geist channeler's Wisdom modifier) or be unable to do so. This ability can be used only defensively, not aggressively; forcing the aura against an incorporeal creature collapses the aura. The geist channeler can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his spiritualist level. The minutes don't need to be continuous, but must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p><p><i>Malevolent Possession (Sp): </i>At 17th level, a geist channeler's phantom can invade the bodies of other creatures. This functions as possession (see page 181). To use this ability, the phantom must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier).

As a standard action, a shade in incorporeal form can deliver the penalty as a touch attack. This penalty does not stack with itself. This is a negative energy effect.</p><p>Umbral Shroud (Su) When the shadow caller reaches 7th level, her shade can emit a 10-foot aura of swirling shadows that grants all allies 20% concealment against creatures without darkvision or the see in darkness ability, and a +4 bonus on Stealth checks.</p><p>Shadow Caster (Sp): When the shadow caller reaches 12th level, her shade gains the ability to cast either shadow conjuration or shadow evocation once per day. It uses its Hit Dice as its caster level, and the DC for these spells equals 10 + 1/2 the shade's Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier. Instead of the normal spell level and percentage of reality for the two spells, the maximum spell level of the duplicated spell is 4th level, and the effects are 40% real.

When fully manifested, a quintessentialist can transfer any equipment she is currently wearing or carrying to her exemplar, allowing it to manifest with weapons, armor, and other equipment, but doing so removes these possessions from the quintessentialist. She can likewise grant her exemplar any feats she knows, losing access to those feats herself while the exemplar remains fully manifested. Projecting an exemplar is draining, however.

This replaces the phantom's antagonistic ability.</p><p>A spiritualist begins play with the aid of a powerful and versatile spirit entity called a phantom. The phantom forms a link with the spiritualist, who forever after can either harbor the creature within her consciousness or manifest it as an ectoplasmic or incorporeal entity. A phantom has the same alignment as the spiritualist, and it can speak all the languages its master can. A spiritualist can harbor her phantom in her consciousness (see the shared consciousness class feature on page 73), manifest it partially (see the bonded manifestation class feature on page 74), or fully manifest it. A fully manifested phantom is treated as a summoned creature from the Ethereal Plane, except it is not sent back to the Ethereal Plane until it is reduced to a negative amount of hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score.</p><p>A spiritualist can fully manifest her phantom through a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When the phantom is fully manifested, the spiritualist can change the form of the phantom's manifestation (either from ectoplasmic to incorporeal or vice versa) as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. When the phantom manifests, its hit points are unchanged from the last time it manifested, unless the phantom was slain and returned to the Ethereal Plane; in this case, the phantom manifests with half its maximum number of hit points. The phantom does not heal naturally, and can be healed only with magic or by being tended to with the Heal skill while fully manifested in ectoplasmic form. The phantom stays fully manifested until it is either returned to the spiritualist's consciousness (a standard action) or banished to the Ethereal Plane. If the phantom is banished to the Ethereal Plane, it can't return to the spiritualist's consciousness or manifest again for 24 hours.</p><p>While fully manifested, a phantom can't be returned to the Ethereal Plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment work normally. Whenever the spiritualist is unconscious or asleep, the phantom immediately returns to the spiritualist's consciousness. If the spiritualist dies, the phantom is returned to the Ethereal Plane, and can't return to the spiritualist's consciousness until 24 hours after the spiritualist is brought back to life. A phantom can't be dismissed or banished (by a spell or any other similar effect) while it resides in the spiritualist's consciousness, as the phantom is protected from such effects by the power of the spiritualist's psyche.</p><p>Fully manifested phantoms can wear armor and use items (though not wield weapons) appropriate to their forms. Any items worn, carried, or held by a phantom are dropped when the phantom returns to the spiritualist's consciousness, and must be retrieved and donned anew if the phantom wishes to use them when it fully manifests in the future.</p><p>Phantoms are self-involved, even jealous, creatures that do not play well with other summoned companions. A phantom refuses to manifest (either fully or as part of a bonded manifestation; see Bonded Manifestation on page 74) in the presence of an eidolon or shadow summoned by the phantom's master. Furthermore, if a phantom is manifested when such a creature is summoned, it immediately retreats into its spiritualist's consciousness, and will not manifest again until the eidolon or shadow is dismissed.</p><p>A fully manifested phantom's abilities, feats, Hit Dice, saving throws, and skills are tied to the spiritualist's class level and increase as the spiritualist gains levels.

The phantom animal uses the statistics of an animal companion and follows the standard animal companion progression in regard to Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throws, skills, feats, natural armor bonus, Strength and Dexterity bonuses, and bonus tricks, but not its special abilities. A phantom animal instead gains the special abilities of a standard phantom listed in the table on page 77 of Occult Adventures. A phantom animal is capable of becoming harbored in the spiritualist's consciousness or becoming fully or partially manifested. A phantom animal is otherwise considered a phantom for the purposes of all feats and abilities.</p><p>At 7th level and every 5 spiritualist levels thereafter, the totem spiritualist can choose to gain an additional phantom animal. This additional phantom animal uses the appropriate statistics for a phantom animal of its level. A totem spiritualist can have only one active phantom animal at a time. Dismissing an active phantom animal to call another requires a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform.</p><p>Instead of gaining an additional phantom animal, the totem spiritualist can choose to empower a phantom animal with which she is already bonded. The first time the phantom animal is empowered, it gains two bonus tricks. The second time it is empowered, the phantom animal gains the hunter's animal focus class ability (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 27), treating the totem spiritualist's spiritualist level as her effective hunter level. The third time it is empowered, the damage dice of the phantom animal's natural attacks increase by one step.</p><p>A totem spiritualist can release a phantom animal from her service much like a druid releases an animal companion. If a totem spiritualist releases a phantom animal from service, she can gain a new one by performing a ritual requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of meditation in an environment where the animal that the phantom resembles typically lives.</p><p>A totem spiritualist treats any druid levels she has as effective spiritualist levels to determine the abilities of her phantom animals, but does not treat her spiritualist levels as effective druid levels to determine the abilities of animal companions.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg

A spirit phantom always has good Fortitude and Reflex saves, and it gains a number of ranks equal to the phantom's Hit Dice in two skills depending on the spirit it represents, as summarized on the table below.</p>  <table>  	<tr>  		<td><b>Spirit</b></td>  		<td><b>Associated Skills</b></td>  	</tr>  	<tr>  		<td>Battle</td>  		<td>Intimidate and Sense Motive</td>  	</tr>  	<tr>  		<td>Bones</td>  		<td>Heal and Stealth</td>  	</tr>  	<tr>  		<td>Flame</td>  		<td>Acrobatics and Intimidate</td>  	</tr>  	<tr>  		<td>Heavens</td>  		<td>Acrobatics and Fly</td>  	</tr>  	<tr>  		<td>Life</td>  		<td>Diplomacy and Heal</td>  	</tr>  	<tr>  		<td>Lore</td>  		<td>Knowledge (arcana) and Linguistics</td>  	</tr>  	<tr>  		<td>Nature</td>  		<td>Knowledge (nature) and Survival</td>  	</tr>  	<tr>  		<td>Stone</td>  		<td>Appraise and Knowledge (engineering)</td>  	</tr>  	<tr>  		<td>Waves</td>  		<td>Diplomacy and Swim</td>  	</tr>  	<tr>  		<td>Wind</td>  		<td>Bluff and Sense Motive</td>  	</tr>  </table>  <p>When fully manifested, the involutionist's spirit phantom gains the special ability normally applied to a shaman's spirit animal. The spirit phantom also gains a single hex from the list of those provided by that spirit. At 7th, 12th, and 17th levels, the spirit phantom gains one additional hex from this list.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg

Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Ectoplasmatist""]]",Spiritualist (Ectoplasmatist),Ectoplasmatist,<id-00008,3,Spiritual Combat,"<p>At 3rd level, as a full-round action, an ectoplasmatist can make all of her attacks with a single light or one-handed ectoplasmic lash wielded in one hand, and also cast a single spiritualist spell with a casting time of one standard action as a free action either before or after making the ectoplasmic lash attacks. The ectoplasmatist takes a -2 penalty on her attack rolls when using spiritual combat. If she decides to cast the spell defensively, she can choose to take an additional penalty on her attack rolls up to her Wisdom bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on her concentration check. If the concentration check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty.</p><p>Also, when the ectoplasmatist casts a spiritualist spell with a range of touch, she can deliver the spell through one of her ectoplasmic lashes. Instead of making the free melee touch attack she would normally use to deliver the spell, the ectoplasmatist can choose to make a free ectoplasmic lash attack at her highest base attack bonus. A successful lash attack deals damage normally and imparts the spell's effects. The ectoplasmatist can't hold the charge if her lash attack misses.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Plague Eater""]]",Spiritualist (Plague Eater),Plague Eater,<id-00027,4,Spiritual Inoculation,"<p>At 4th level, whenever a plague eater is within reach of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom, she gains a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against disease.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Geist Channeler""]]",Spiritualist (Geist Channeler),Geist Channeler,<id-00026,3,Spiritual Manifestation,"<p>Because of the nature of her phantom, a geist channeler can use the bonded manifestation ability to manifest his phantom only in incorporeal form.

Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Onmyoji""]]",Spiritualist (Onmyoji),Onmyoji,<id-00005,1,Spiritual Resistance,"<p>An onmyoji's phantom provides her with protection from supernatural forces. While the phantom is confined within the onmyoji's consciousness (not stranded on the Ethereal Plane or fully manifested), it grants her a +2 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey, outsiders, and incorporeal undead. At 6th level and every 6 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). This ability replaces shared consciousness and fused consciousness.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Fated Guide""]]",Spiritualist (Fated Guide),Fated Guide,<id-00027,3,Thanatopic Bonded Manifestation,"<p>A 3rd level, a fated guide can bond with her phantom to channel the influence of Pharasma and her servitors. When a spiritualist gains this ability, she must replace her ability to form either an ectoplasmic bonded manifestation or an incorporeal bonded manifestation.</p><p>When the fated guide uses this thanatopic bond, she gains access to the benefits of her phantom's Deific Obedience feat, and can use speak with dead as per the spell, asking a maximum of one question per spiritualist level she has each day, and no more than one question per corpse; asking a question and getting an answer requires 2 full rounds.</p><p>At 8th level, the fated guide can act normally even after being reduced below 0 hit points. The spiritualist immediately dies if reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to her Constitution score. She takes 1 extra point of damage each round she performs a strenuous action, such as attacking or casting a spell, and immediately falls unconscious and begins dying if she dismisses the thanatopic bond or the duration of bonded manifestation expires. Maintaining her nearly dead form is taxing, and each round that she remains active below 0 hit points consumes 2 rounds of bonded manifestation's duration.</p><p>At 13th level, while using her thanatopic bonded manifestation, the fated guide can cast antilife shell as a spell-like ability. Maintaining this spell quickly exhausts her phantom, and each round she maintains the spell consumes 2 rounds of bonded manifestation's duration.</p><p>At 18th level, the fated guide's touch banishes the unquiet dead. She can deal 10d6 points of positive energy damage (Will half; DC = 10 + 1/2 the fated guide's spiritualist level + her Wisdom modifier) as a touch attack against undead creatures. An undead creature that successfully saves against this touch attack is immune to the same fated guide's positive energy touch for 24 hours.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Priest of the Fallen""]]",Spiritualist (Priest of the Fallen),Priest of the Fallen,<id-00013,20,True Legend,"<p>At 20th level, a priest of the fallen is strong enough to confine a phantom in her consciousness as a standard action.

Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Totem Spiritualist""]]",Spiritualist (Totem Spiritualist),Totem Spiritualist,<id-00024,17,Twin Phantoms,"<p>At 17th level, the totem spiritualist can call upon two of her phantom animals at once. As a standard action, she can manifest a second phantom animal. The phantom animal remains for a number of rounds per day equal to her spiritualist level and can be dismissed as a free action.

Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Shadow Caller""]]",Spiritualist (Shadow Caller),Shadow Caller,<id-00020,10,Umbral Aura,"<p>At 10th level, a shadow caller is wreathed in an aura of darkness while her shade inhabits her shadow, gaining 50% concealment against creatures without darkvision or the see in darkness ability. Additionally, the shadow caller's square and all adjacent squares are treated as areas of dim illumination while she benefits from this ability; this second effect counts as a 4th-level darkness spell for the purpose of adjudicating light and darkness effects. While her shade inhabits her shadow, the shadow caller can hide in plain sight, even if an observing creature has darkvision or see in darkness.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Necrologist""]]",Spiritualist (Necrologist),Necrologist,<id-00026,1,Undead Phantom,"<p>A necrologist's phantom is undead, rather than an outsider. It has normal undead immunities and no Constitution score; uses d8 Hit Dice, each of which is modified by the phantom's Charisma modifier as normal; and gains the abilities below at the levels indicated. An undead phantom otherwise follows the standard phantom rules (for instance, its base attack bonus and skills don't change to match undead).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Fated Guide""]]",Spiritualist (Fated Guide),Fated Guide,<id-00023,16,Undeniable Bond,"<p>When the fated guide reaches 16th level, her phantom gains an additional +4 bonus on saving throws against banishment, dismissal, or other similar effects, for a total of +8.

Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Haunted""]]",Spiritualist (Haunted),Haunted,<id-00008,3,Usurp Manifestation,"<p>At 3rd level, the haunted's phantom begins to subtly subvert the relationship with its master, gaining rather than granting power from the connection. When fully manifested in ectoplasmic form, the phantom can use its usurp manifestation ability to draw upon the haunted's body to strengthen its ectoplasmic might, temporarily weakening the spiritualist in order to increase its own power. The phantom must activate this ability as an immediate action at the start of the spiritualist's turn, and it can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + the haunted's spiritualist level. The rounds don't need to be consecutive, and the phantom can dismiss the effects of a usurped manifestation as a free action on its turn. While this ability is in effect, the haunted's features become sunken and withdrawn, and she gains the nauseated condition until the effect ends. Conversely, the phantom surges in size and power, becoming one size category larger (as if affected by an enlarge person spell) and increasing its natural armor bonus to AC by 2 for the effect's duration. If the spiritualist prevents or mitigates the nauseated condition, the phantom is unable to siphon energy and doesn't gain the benefits of usurp manifestation.</p><p>At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter (13th and 18th levels), the phantom gains new abilities while using usurp manifestation.</p><p><i>Usurp Spell: </i>At 8th level, while using usurp manifestation, the phantom can leech spell slots from the haunted to increase its own power. The phantom can reach through the etheric tether as a swift action to drain the nauseated haunted's psychic spell energy, effectively taking any touch spell or spell with a target of 'you' that the haunted knows and casting it on itself (assuming the haunted has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level). This ability consumes two of the haunted's spell slots of the appropriate level and otherwise follows the rules for the share spells and deliver touch spells abilities.</p><p><i>Teleplasmic Surge: </i>At 13th level, when using usurp manifestation, the phantom gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.</p><p><i>Ferocious Phantom: </i>At 18th level, when using usurp manifestation the phantom gains DR 10/slashing and spell resistance equal to 11 + the haunted's spiritualist level (this spell resistance doesn't apply to spells originating from the spiritualist or from the usurp spell ability).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg

The ward spiritualist does not gain additional spells from her ward implement, and it always starts each day with mental focus invested equal to half her class level (minimum 1).</p><p>When she gains her ward implement, the ward spiritualist must choose either to have a physical implement or to be the implement herself. If she chooses to have a physical implement, her spiritualist spells include it as a focus component, and she can change what item is her implement when she regains her spells at the start of each day. Her implement must be an item that can be held in one hand, and it cannot be a manufactured weapon. If the ward spiritualist chooses to be her own ward implement, her spiritualist spells always have a somatic component in addition to their other components; this component does not become an emotion component.</p><p>She can remove the focus or somatic component of her spells, but this requires a concentration check with a DC equal to 15 + twice the spell level, which is increased for a thought component as normal.</p><p>She gains a focus power for her implement school at 2nd level, and again at 6th level and 12th level. She must meet the prerequisites of these focus powers, treating her spiritualist level as her occultist level for focus power prerequisites. She also treats her spiritualist level as her occultist level for feat prerequisites.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg

Spiritualist,"[[""Spiritualist""],[""Zeitgeist Binder""]]",Spiritualist (Zeitgeist Binder),Zeitgeist Binder,<id-00026,1,Zeitgeist,"<p>A zeitgeist binder's phantom is called a zeitgeist. In addition to an emotion, a zeitgeist is tied to one aspect of its settlement: corruption, crime, economy, law, lore, or society (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 204). In order to select an aspect, that aspect of the settlement must have a positive modifier (for instance, a settlement with a negative lore modifier or a modifier of 0 could not manifest a lore zeitgeist). Although a zeitgeist personifies a single chosen settlement, a zeitgeist binder can call it anywhere, but outside the bounds of its settlement, it loses the benefits of its settlement aspect and settlement avatar abilities.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/water_07.jpg
