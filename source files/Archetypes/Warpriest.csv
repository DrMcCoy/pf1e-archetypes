The restriction on alignment domains still applies.</p><p>Each blessing grants a minor power at 1st level and a major power at 10th level. A warpriest can call upon the power of his blessings a number of times per day (in any combination) equal to 3 + 1/2 his warpriest level (to a maximum of 13 times per day at 20th level).

He must choose a deity whose alignment is opposed to his own deity's alignment in at least one way (good versus evil or law versus chaos); preferably, he should choose a deity whose alignment diametrically opposes that of his own deity. If the divine champion worships a deity whose alignment is neutral, he must instead select a deity whose alignment is chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, or lawful good.

The divine champion gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, and Sense Motive checks against followers of the enemy faith, as well as a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls made against them. Additionally, he can attempt Knowledge skill checks relating to the deity and its church untrained, even if the DC is higher than 10.</p><p>Every 6 warpriest levels thereafter (12th and 18th level), the divine champion can select an additional deity to oppose.
