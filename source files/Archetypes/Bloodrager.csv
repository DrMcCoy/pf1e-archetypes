,Bloodrager,"[[""Bloodrager""],[""Urban Bloodrager""]]",Bloodrager (Urban Bloodrager),Urban Bloodrager,<id-00003,7,Adopted Magic,"<p>At 7th level, an urban bloodrager learns some of the secrets of other magical traditions from other denizens of the city. She can select from the bard or magus spell list any spell of a level she can cast, and add it to her bloodrager spell list and to her bloodrager spells known. At 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the urban bloodrager can add another such spell to her spell list and spells known. If she chooses to learn a new spell in place of an old one, she can exchange a bard or magus spell for another. This ability replaces damage reduction.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_13.jpg
,Bloodrager,"[[""Bloodrager""],[""Hag-Riven""]]",Bloodrager (Hag-Riven),Hag-Riven,<id-00035,1,Arcane Influence,"<p>A hag-riven bloodrager does not gain proficiency with martial weapons and must choose from one of the following bloodrager bloodlines: arcane, destined, elemental, fey, or hag.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_13.jpg
,Bloodrager,"[[""Bloodrager""],[""Steelblood""]]",Bloodrager (Steelblood),Steelblood,<id-00004,5,Armor Training,"<p>At 5th level, a steelblood learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every 4 levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), these bonuses increase by 1, to a maximum 4-point reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus. This ability stacks with the fighter class feature of the same name. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_13.jpg
,Bloodrager,"[[""Bloodrager""],[""Steelblood""]]",Bloodrager (Steelblood),Steelblood,<id-00008,2,Armored Swiftness,"<p>At 2nd level, a steelblood moves faster in medium and heavy armor. When wearing medium or heavy armor, a steelblood can move 5 feet faster than normal in that armor, to a maximum of his unencumbered speed. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_13.jpg

He is considered to be both a phantom and a spiritualist for the purposes of abilities whose effect references both a phantom and a spiritualist, such as a dedication phantom's dutiful strike, and treats his bloodrager level as both his spiritualist level and his phantom Hit Dice when determining abilities and save DCs. This ability does not allow the id rager to become incorporeal.</p><p>At 4th level, the id rager gains Lightning Reflexes, Great Fortitude, or Iron Will as a bonus feat.</p><p>At 8th level, the id rager can meditate for 1 hour to change his atavistic focus for 24 hours or until he decides to return to his permanent atavistic focus as a free action. When he changes his focus, he loses access to his Skill Focus feat and the feat he gained at 4th level, and he wields emotional focus powers as if his spiritualist level and phantom Hit Dice were 3 lower.</p><p>At 12th level, the id rager gains Skill Focus in both of the skills associated with his atavistic focus. If circumstances cause him to lose one Skill Focus feat, he loses both.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_13.jpg
,Bloodrager,"[[""Bloodrager""],[""Id Rager""]]",Bloodrager (Id Rager),Id Rager,<id-00006,4,Atavistic Caster,"<p>At 4th level, a id rager's bloodrager spells are treated as psychic magic (Occult Adventures 144). The bloodrager's bloodrage does not prevent him from casting spells with emotional components, and he is considered to be a psychic spellcaster for the purposes of prerequisites (such as for the prerequisites of psychic duels and occult skill unlocks). This ability alters the bloodrager's spellcasting and replaces eschew materials.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_13.jpg
,Bloodrager,"[[""Bloodrager""],[""Rageshaper""]]",Bloodrager (Rageshaper),Rageshaper,<id-00009,4,Bestial Aspect,"<p>At 4th level, whenever a rageshaper gains a natural attack through the use of a polymorph spell, he can increase the damage done by that attack by one die. If the spell grants multiple natural attacks, the rageshaper must choose one kind of natural attack for the ability to enhance. At 9th level, if the rageshaper's altered form grants him a new mode of movement, that movement's base speed increases by 10 feet. This is an enhancement bonus. If the rageshaper's bloodrage powers already grant natural attacks or alternate modes of movement, then the bonuses granted by bestial aspect also apply to these bloodrage powers. This ability replaces blood sanctuary.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_13.jpg

While the bloodrider is bloodraging and on his feral mount, he grants the mount all the immunities and resistances he gains from bloodline powers. Furthermore, whenever the bloodrager is affected by a spell or spell-like ability with the range of personal while on the feral mount, the feral mount also gains the benefit of that spell. This ability replaces the bloodline feat gained at 9th level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_13.jpg
,Bloodrager,"[[""Bloodrager""],[""Steelblood""]]",Bloodrager (Steelblood),Steelblood,<id-00003,7,Blood Deflection,"<p>At 7th level, as an immediate action a steelblood can sacrifice a bloodrager spell slot to gain a deflection bonus to AC equal to the level of the spell sacrificed. The deflection bonus lasts until the start of his next turn. This ability can be applied after an attack roll is made against the steelblood, allowing the steelblood to convert a hit into a miss if the deflection bonus is high enough.

At 2nd level, while bloodraging a spelleater gains fast healing 1 (Bestiary 300). At 7th level and every 3 levels thereafter, this increases by 1 (to a maximum of fast healing 6 at 19th level). If the spelleater gains an increase to damage reduction from a bloodline, feat, or other ability, he is considered to have an effective damage reduction of 0, and the increase is added to this effective damage reduction. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and damage reduction.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_13.jpg

These claws are primary attacks and deal 1d4 points of damage each (1d3 for a Small creature) plus the hag-riven's Strength modifier.

Instead, she can apply a +4 morale bonus to her Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength. This bonus increases to +6 when she gains greater bloodrage and to +8 when she gains mighty bloodrage. She can apply the full bonus to one ability score or split the bonus between several scores in increments of 2. When using a controlled bloodrage, an urban bloodrager gains no bonus on Will saves, takes no penalties to AC, and can still use Charisma-, Dexterity-, and Intelligence-based skills. A controlled bloodrage still counts as a bloodrage for the purposes of any spells, feats, and other effects. This ability alters bloodrage.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_13.jpg

A Medium bloodrider can select a camel or a horse. A Small bloodrider can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or riding dog if he is at least 8th level.

If he succeeds, the spell is treated as if the rageshaper had the Extend Spell metamagic feat. The rageshaper must be the spell's intended target or cast a spell with a range of personal to gain this effect. If the rageshaper casts a spell that is linked to the rageshaper's own bloodline, such as a rageshaper with the elemental bloodline who casts elemental body I, the spell is automatically extended without forcing the concentration check, so long as the rageshaper casts it while in a bloodrage.
