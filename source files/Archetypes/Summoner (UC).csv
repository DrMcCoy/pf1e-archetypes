This does not affect other abilities that depend on alignment (such as smite evil). The devil impostor can suppress this effect for 1 minute as a standard action.

The eidolon still uses its actual alignment when resolving all other alignment-dependent abilities, effects, and spells. The eidolon can have any subtype, though its appearance always remains that of a devil, and it can select only evolutions available to its true subtype. This modifies the normal eidolon rules.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg

The eidolon can do this once per day at 10th level, and an additional time per day every 4 summoner levels thereafter (maximum of 3 times per day at 18th level).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg

He makes the choice before rolling. Once per day while his eidolon uses the aid another action to assist him in such a check, if the god caller would improve a target's attitude toward him, or gain a success if using the individual influence rules (Ultimate Intrigue 102), he instead improves that target's attitude by 2 steps or it counts as 2 successes.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg

The storm caller can expend a use of his summon storm's fury ability as a standard action to create an instantaneous line of lightning between him and his eidolon, provided that the eidolon is within 60 feet of him. The lightning arc deals the same amount of damage to all creatures in the line and has the same save DC as a bolt of lightning from the summon storm's fury ability (unlike call lightning, this damage is dealt only once). The storm caller and his eidolon are not affected by this lightning.</p><p>At 12th level, the storm caller gains the benefit of his eidolon's resistance (electricity) or immunity (electricity) evolution whenever he is within 30 feet of the eidolon.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg

This functions as a modified alter self spell, transforming the devil impostor into a replica of her eidolon. She gains a single natural attack possessed by her eidolon, and if her eidolon is smaller than Small or larger than Medium, she assumes the form of a Small- or Medium-sized version of her eidolon, respectively. The transformation lasts for 10 minutes x her unchained summoner level or until the eidolon is resummoned. This ability replaces transposition.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg

It can use guidance as a spell-like ability at will. However, the eidolon and the god caller must remain within 50 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 50 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by half.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg

This grants the devil binder the bloodline powers of the infernal sorcerer bloodline (gained at the following levels): corrupting touch (4th), infernal resistances (8th), hellfire (12th), on dark wings (16th), and power of the Pit (20th).

Each of these spell-like abilities is usable once per day, and the eidolon's caster level is equal to the devil binder's summoner level.

As it isn't truly a plant, it doesn't gain the plant immunities.</p><p>Base Form: The leshy caller chooses one of the base forms listed below for her eidolon.

The eidolon's alignment always matches that of the soulbound summoner, regardless of its subtype. In addition, at 1st level, the summoner must choose an oracle curse, using his summoner level as his oracle level for determining the curse's effects. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. A summoner that gains spells for his list of spells known as a result of his curse must be able to cast spells of the appropriate level in order to cast the learned spell.</p><p>The glowing rune that the soulbound summoner shares with his eidolon always appears on a place symbolic of his pactbond curse. For example, a summoner who chooses the clouded vision curse might have his summoner's rune manifest on one of his eyes, while a summoner who chooses the tongues curse might have his summoner's rune appear on his lips. A soulbound summoner's eidolon is summoned from his own psyche rather than a different plane, so spells such as banishment and dismissal do not work when cast on the eidolon.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
