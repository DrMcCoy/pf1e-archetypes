The concentration check DC for both abilities is equal to 15 + double the level of the conjuration spell.</p><p>A cold iron warden can take other feats to add to this ability such as Improved Channeling, but not feats that alter this ability, such as Command Undead.

Continuous effects from permanent magical items do not cause this effect. Within the aura, dispel checks against transmutation effects gain a +4 bonus.

As an immediate action whenever an enemy conf irms a critical hit against an ally within 30 feet, the vigilant defender can choose to accept half the damage. If she does so, similar to the shield other spell, any of her damage reduction, resistances, or immunities do not apply to the damage she takes.</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-canterbury-cross.webp

The effect to be transferred is chosen by the sin eater and affects her as if she were the original target, continuing its duration (if any) and preventing any further effect on the original bearer. For example, the inquisitor could transfer a lethal disease to herself, or petrify herself to restore a petrified comrade. The sin eater can use this ability as often as desired, even using it multiple times on the same creature. This ability replaces exploit weakness.</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-canterbury-cross.webp

It takes her 1d3 x 10 minutes to conceal or alter evidence in a 10-foot-by-10-foot area. She uses Disguise to alter evidence or Stealth to conceal it, though bonuses and penalties based on her abilities or effects that disguise or hide her own body (such as from disguise self, a cloak of elvenkind, or the size modifier on Stealth checks) do not apply. A creature attempting to investigate the scene using Perception must succeed at the original Perception DC or a DC equal to the traceless operative's check, whichever is higher, in order to discover the true evidence. A creature who fails against a traceless operative's Disguise check potentially also derives the false evidence planted by the traceless operative.</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-canterbury-cross.webp

Whenever she confirms a critical hit against a foe that is unaware of her presence, she ignores any damage reduction the target might have and adds her Wisdom bonus to her damage roll (this multiplies on the critical hit as normal); in addition, if the target has regeneration, the creature loses regeneration on the round following the critical hit and can die normally during that round. Creatures whose regeneration always functions are immune to this ability.</p><p>Finally, if the umbral stalker deals energy damage to a creature unaware of her presence with vulnerability to that energy type, she deals 2 extra points of damage per die rolled.</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-canterbury-cross.webp

This acts like the occultist's focus powers and mental focus class features (see pages 47 and 48, respectively), with the following adjustments.</p><p>Each day, a relic hunter has a number of points of deific focus equal to her inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier, and she must spend 1 hour in prayer with her relics to invest them with divine power. These points refresh at the start of each day.</p><p>At 1st level, the relic hunter learns the two base focus powers from her chosen relic schools and can select one more focus power from the list of those made available by her chosen schools.

In addition, at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, she learns a new focus power selected from all of the powers granted by all of the relic schools she knows.

Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throws against a focus power is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor's class level + the inquisitor's Wisdom modifier.

The agreement, whether it's a trade contract, a truce, or a political marriage, must be as detailed as possible and then signed in the oathkeeper's presence by every creature involved. Creatures must sign of their own free will-any magical or physical coercion will cause the contract to crumble into ash when the oathkeeper attempts to place her seal upon it. So long as no mystic or physical force is influencing any participating creature, the oathkeeper can mystically seal the arrangement with her personal symbol, binding all signing parties into upholding their ends of the bargain for the length of time spelled out in the agreement.</p><p>Should any oathbound creature break the exact wording of the contract, the agreement is dissolved and the offending creature is cursed, taking a penalty on all d20 rolls equal to the oathkeeper's Wisdom modifier for a number of weeks equal to the oathkeeper's inquisitor level. Furthermore, the inquisitor's symbol appears as a mystic symbol on the offending creature's throat and hands, allowing the oathkeeper to know the creature's location at all times, as per the discern location spell.</p><p>If a creature is forced into breaking the agreement by magic or overwhelming physical force (for example, breaking an agreement not to harm via a compulsion spell or by physically hurling an oathbound creature to deal damage to another), then the agreement dissipates harmlessly. The oathkeeper's curse is a curse effect, but it can be removed only with a miracle or wish spell.</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-canterbury-cross.webp

A few extreme faiths actually require the inquisitor to eat some of the body of the slain enemy.</p><p>At 8th level, when a sin eater eats the sins of a creature that would rise as an undead (such as someone slain by a shadow, spectre, or vampire), the sin eater may choose to accept 1 temporary negative level to absorb the taint in the corpse, preventing it from rising as an undead.

,Inquisitor,"[[""Inquisitor""],[""Living Grimoire""]]",Inquisitor (Living Grimoire),Living Grimoire,<inquisitortruejudgment_20,20,Word of God,"<p>At 20th level, a living grimoire can smite his foes with the holy word of his deity. Up to seven times per day, the inquisitor can make a single melee attack with his holy book against a target. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or die (DC = 10 + 1/2 the living grimoire's inquisitor level + his Intelligence modifier). Regardless of whether the save is successful, the target creature is immune to the living grimoire's word of god ability for 24 hours. Once the living grimoire uses this ability, he can't use it again for 1d4 rounds.</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-canterbury-cross.webp

This functions as a suggestion spell that is dismissible, affects the construct despite its normal immunity to mind-affecting effects, and has a caster level equal to the keeper of constructs' inquisitor level. The construct can resist the command with a successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the keeper of constructs' inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier). A construct that successfully saves is immune to this ability for the following 24 hours. This effect immediately ends if the construct is attacked while under its influence.</p><p>If an affected construct was being controlled by a creature, that individual can regain control of the construct with a successful Charisma check (attempting this check requires a standard action) opposed by the inquisitor's Charisma check. On a success, the original creature regains full control of the construct and this effect ends.</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-canterbury-cross.webp
