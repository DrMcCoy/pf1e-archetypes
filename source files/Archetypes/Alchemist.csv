It takes 10 minutes to brew a dose of this concoction, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. An aerochemist can maintain only 1 dose of this concoction at a time-if he brews a second dose, any existing concoction becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, an aeromantic concoction that is not in the aerochemist's possession becomes inert until he picks it up again. Anyone other than the aerochemist who attempts to drink his aeromantic concoction is affected in the same fashion as is a non-alchemist who drinks an alchemist's mutagen.</p><p>When consumed, an aerochemist's aeromantic concoction makes his body become incredibly buoyant for 10 minutes per alchemist level. The concoction grants the aerochemist a +5 bonus on Acrobatics checks to attempt high jumps or long jumps, and he is always treated as having a running start when attempting long jumps. In addition, the aerochemist gains the benefits of feather fall for the concoction's duration. At 6th level, the aerochemist gains the benefits of fly for the concoction's duration. At 10th level, the aerochemist can choose to gain the benefits of air walk instead of fly for the concoction's duration. At 14th level, the duration of the concoction increases to 1 hour per alchemist level.</p><p>An aerochemist with the infusion discovery can instead create a shared alchemical concoction intended for his allies. This shared concoction grants the same benefits as the normal aeromantic concoction, except the duration is only 1 minute per alchemist level its creator has. At 14th level, the duration increases to 10 minutes per alchemist level. An aerochemist can have only a standard concoction or shared concoction in effect, not both.</p><p>This replaces mutagen, swift poisoning, and persistent mutagen. An aeromantic alchemist can never gain the mutagen, cognatogen, or inspired cognatogen ability, even from a discovery or another class.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/grand-violet.jpg

This special bomb remains inert until 1 round after it leaves the alchemical sapper's possession, after which time it becomes armed. When a creature enters a square containing an armed trip mine, it explodes, dealing normal bomb damage to all creatures in its square (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemical sapper's alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier; Reflex half ) and splash damage to every creature adjacent to that square. A trip mine can be disarmed with a successful Disable Device check (with a DC equal to the trip mine's save DC); otherwise, it lasts until the next time the alchemical sapper refreshes his daily bombs.</p><p>If the alchemical sapper expends four uses of his bomb class feature, his trip mine deals damage as per a demolition bomb; this does not count against his daily uses of the demolition bomb ability.

This bomb deals double his normal bomb damage, half of which is bludgeoning and piercing damage, the other half of which is fire damage. This bomb ignores a number of points of hardness up to 1/2 the alchemical sapper's level (minimum 1). This counts as an ability that modifies the alchemical sapper's bomb, so it doesn't stack with other discoveries that modify bombs. The alchemical sapper can't use his demolition bomb with the fast bombs discovery. An alchemical sapper can only expend one use of his bomb class feature to create a demolition bomb once per day.

Setting a bomb trap is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A bomb trap fills a single 5-foot square and cannot be placed in the same area as any other trap. The alchemical trapper needs the same materials required for making a bomb. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the trap, Disable Device checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid it are equal to the DC for the alchemical trapper's bombs. All bomb traps have location triggers and do not reset. The alchemical trapper can use any one discovery that applies to a bomb when making a bomb trap. The bomb trap lasts 10 minutes for each alchemist level the trapper possesses. If the bomb trap is not disabled or exploded within that time frame, the trap becomes inert.

Since thrown weapons don't work well underwater, when the aquachymist creates a bomb, he either weights it or includes excess air as part of the action of creating the bomb, granting the bomb his choice of swiftly rising or swiftly sinking buoyancy and allowing him to target foes directly above or below him. If the attack misses, the bomb doesn't deal splash damage, but instead continues to travel up or down until it loses potency at the end of the alchemist's turn; the exception is when the aquachymist throws a swiftly sinking bomb close to the bottom, in which case it might reach the bottom and explode there.

An alchemist can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert-their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst-the alchemist can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster's component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day-once created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the alchemist for years.Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus.

An alchemist can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert-their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst-the alchemist can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster's component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day-once created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the alchemist for years. Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, an alchemist's bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. The damage of an alchemist's bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike). Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb's minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. Alchemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the Discovery ability) as they level up.

An alchemist can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert-their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst-the alchemist can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster's component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day-once created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the alchemist for years. Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, an alchemist's bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. The damage of an alchemist's bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike). Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb's minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. Alchemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the Discovery ability) as they level up.
