At 7th level, she cannot add her studied target bonus on Disguise checks. Instead, when using any bow or crossbow against her studied target underwater, the spire diver ignores the normal penalty for shooting underwater and instead treats the weapon as though its range increment were 10 feet. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the range increment increases by 10 feet, to a maximum of 50 feet.</p><p>When using a bow or crossbow that already has an underwater range increment, such as an underwater crossbow, the spire diver adds the range increment gained from studied target as a bonus to the weapon's usual underwater range increment, though the combined range increment cannot exceed the weapon's normal range increment.</p><p>This alters studied target and stalker.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_06.jpg

The save DC is Charisma-based and is modified by the slayer's studied target bonus if the creature is also her studied target.

In addition to using these shadow doubles as mirror images in his square, he can move his doubles as part of his own move action, dividing his movement between himself and his doubles.

Shadow doubles provide flanking for the ankou's shadow and his allies, but they do not possess teamwork feats or special abilities that alter the effects of flanking or aiding another.

Although a shadow double appears to duplicate the ankou's shadow's gear, this gear is part of its form; a shadow double's gear cannot be destroyed, dropped, or stolen. A shadow double disappears if it ventures more than 50 feet from the ankou's shadow or if it leaves his line of sight or effect. A shadow double that is hit by an attack roll or takes any damage is destroyed. The AC of a shadow double is equal to the ankou's shadow's touch AC, and it has the same CMD and saving throw bonuses as the ankou's shadow. Shadow doubles possess evasion if the ankou's shadow does.

In addition, once per day as a standard action, a Pureblade can shed a magical effect placed on him by an aberration as break enchantment, using his slayer level as his caster level. A Pureblade can use this ability twice per day at 12th level and three times per day at 16th level.

,Slayer,"[[""Slayer""],[""Covenbane""]]",Slayer (Covenbane),Covenbane,<id-00008,2,Studied Coven,"<p>At 2nd level, a covenbane can designate an entire coven as his studied target by studying any single member. He applies his studied target bonus against all members of the studied creature's coven, and all members of the coven count as one target for the purposes of determining the maximum number of studied targets a slayer can maintain. This bonus remains even if one or more members of the coven die after the covenbane studies them. Beginning at 7th level, the covenbane can designate other magically linked creatures, such as those bound by a hivemind or a telepathic bond spell, as a coven, but he can target only three members of such a link. Studying a coven always requires a move action, even if the slayer could normally study a target with a swift or immediate action.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_06.jpg
,Slayer,"[[""Slayer""],[""Velvet Blade""]]",Slayer (Velvet Blade),Velvet Blade,<id-00032,1,Studied Socialite,"<p>A velvet blade focuses her studies on social infiltration rather than brute force, believing it is easier to kill an opponent quietly and unprepared than in a loud battle. She adds her studied target bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, Stealth, and Survival checks against studied opponents, as well as to the DCs of slayer class abilities she uses against such opponents.

,Slayer,"[[""Slayer""],[""Spawn Slayer""]]",Slayer (Spawn Slayer),Spawn Slayer,<id-00003,1,Studied Spawn,"<p>A spawn slayer specializes in fighting against larger, single targets. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks against a studied target increase by 1, as do the DCs of slayer abilities against a studied target.

This bonus is reduced by 1 (minimum 0) if the target is not an arcane spellcaster, or a being called or summoned by arcane magic.

,Slayer,"[[""Slayer""],[""Bounty Hunter""]]",Slayer (Bounty Hunter),Bounty Hunter,<id-00010,6,Submission Hold,"<p>At 6th level, when a bounty hunter attempts a grapple combat maneuver check to deal damage, he can choose to add his sneak attack damage to the grapple damage for that attack. He takes a -5 penalty on the combat maneuver check if he does this. This sneak attack damage is nonlethal damage, unless the bounty hunter is able to deal normal damage with a grapple and chooses to do so.

,Slayer,"[[""Slayer""],[""Turncoat""]]",Slayer (Turncoat),Turncoat,<id-00029,14,Sudden Betrayal,"<p>At 14th level, as a standard action a turncoat can choose a single creature within 30 feet. He gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks against this target. If the target has an attitude of indifferent or better toward him, the first attack roll the turncoat makes against that target is automatically treated as threatening a critical hit.

If the witch killer selects a rage power that can normally be used only once per rage (eater of magic, spell sunder, or sunder enchantment), he can use it once per day per 5 slayer levels he possesses, though no more than once per round in any event. The other rage powers affect the slayer constantly, though the superstition and witch hunter rage powers apply only against arcane spells and spell-like abilities and the creatures that use them.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_06.jpg

He is trained in applying poison in this way and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to his ammunition. The toxic sniper can create a number of toxic shots per day equal to half his slayer level plus his Wisdom modifier.

,Slayer,"[[""Slayer""],[""Velvet Blade""]]",Slayer (Velvet Blade),Velvet Blade,<id-00033,7,Treacherous Blade,"<p>At 7th level, a velvet blade can capitalize on how others underestimate her and allow her close to them, assuming she is harmless. She gains the BetrayerUC feat as a bonus feat, whether or not she meets the prerequisites. Additionally, when making her first attack against a studied target that believes her to be harmless or to be an ally, the attack counts as a sneak attack, even if the target isn't flanked or denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, and the velvet blade gains +2d6 sneak attack damage, increasing by 1d6 at 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter. Even if she immediately attacks the target again (such as by continuing a full attack), only the first attack gains these benefits, since the target immediately realizes the velvet blade is something more than she seemed.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_06.jpg

While unfettered, each shadow double can move and attack as if it were the ankou's shadow without using any of his actions. A creature struck by a shadow double can attempt a Will save (DC 20 + the ankou's shadow's Intelligence modifier) each time it takes damage to recognize the illusion. If it succeeds, the target treats all the shadow doubles as 20% real, as the spell shadow conjuration. The shadow doubles cannot use the shadow double ability.

Once he has studied an area, the cleaner can attempt a Disguise check to alter evidence or a Stealth check to conceal evidence (by doing things such as cleaning up bloodstains, obscuring footprints, moving a dead body, and so on). Altering an area takes 1d3 10 minutes of work per 10-foot square. Anyone attempting to determine what actually happened in that area must succeed at an opposed Perception check against the result of the cleaner's Disguise or Stealth check (cleaner's choice) or accept the altered scene as truth. The cleaner gains a +4 bonus on this check, on Sleight of Hand checks to hide objects from that location on his person, and on Stealth checks to hide within or escape from that location.
