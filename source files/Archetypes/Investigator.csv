The benefits she receives from poison resistance and poison immunity also apply against harmful potions and other ingested substances with negative effects, such as drugs.</p>",icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp
,Investigator,"[[""Investigator""],[""Mastermind""]]",Investigator (Mastermind),Mastermind,<id-00004,1,A Quiet Word,"<p>A mastermind's reputation precedes him. At 1st level, once per day a mastermind can spend 10 minutes preparing an ally to make a single Diplomacy or Intimidate check (mastermind's choice when preparing the ally) within the next 24-hour period at the mastermind's behest. This skill check uses the mastermind's skill ranks instead of the ally's. The mastermind's affected ally still uses its own ability bonus for the check.</p><p>Furthermore, when a mastermind uses this ability, he can expend one use of inspiration to give the ally use of the inspiration die when making the check.</p><p>At 3rd level, a mastermind can use this ability an additional time each day, and the number of times he can use this ability per day increases by 1 for every third level thereafter. Multiple uses of this ability on the same ally grant that ally the benef it on additional Diplomacy or Intimidate checks.</p><p>At 12th level, a mastermind can use this ability to bestow on his ally the use of his skill ranks, similar to the 1stlevel effects of this ability but with a wider range of skills to choose from. The mastermind can only bestow this for a skill check that he can use inspiration on without expending uses of inspiration. For instance, a mastermind with the underworld inspiration talent can bolster his ally's Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, or Sleight of Hand skill checks, selecting a single skill for each use of the ability. This ability replaces trapfinding and trap sense.</p>",icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp
,Investigator,"[[""Investigator""],[""Ruthless Agent""]]",Investigator (Ruthless Agent),Ruthless Agent,<id-00036,4,Agonizing Strike,"<p>At 4th level, a ruthless agent has learned how to finesse her attacks to discomfort a foe. When she deals damage using her studied strike, she can make this damage nonlethal (regardless of whether her weapon normally deals lethal or nonlethal damage), forcing the target to succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the ruthless agent's level + her Intelligence modifier) or be sickened for 1 round and take a -2 penalty on Will saving throws for 1 minute. Multiple agonizing strikes do not worsen the condition or impose an additional penalty on Will saves, but they do increase the duration of both effects.</p>",icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp
,Investigator,"[[""Investigator""],[""Lamplighter""]]",Investigator (Lamplighter),Lamplighter,<id-00005,2,Alchemical Illumination,"<p>At 2nd level, as a standard action, a lamplighter can cast certain light spells by burning a magic extract, infusion, or potion of a spell of the same or greater level than the light spell in a lit lantern or torch. If the spell has a range of touch, the lantern or torch counts as the object touched. The spell's DC, if any, equals 10 + spell level + the lamplighter's Intelligence modifier. At 2nd level, the lamplighter can cast light and continual flame (24 hour duration). At 5th level, the lamplighter can cast daylight and discovery torchUC. At 8th level, the lamplighter can cast searing light. At 11th level, the lamplighter can cast judgment lightUC. The lamplighter need not have an active judgment to cast this spell, can choose what color of judgment light is created, can use his alignment for golden light, and can select any element for copper light. This ability replaces poison lore, poison resistance, and poison immunity.</p>",icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp
,Investigator,"[[""Investigator""],[""Cult Hunter""]]",Investigator (Cult Hunter),Cult Hunter,<id-00025,3,Ambush Defense,"<p>At 3rd level, a cult hunter gains a +1 insight bonus during a surprise round triggered by his enemies on Reflex saves and to his AC. This bonus increases by 1 for every 3 investigator levels beyond 3rd.</p>",icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp
,Investigator,"[[""Investigator""],[""Star Watcher""]]",Investigator (Star Watcher),Star Watcher,<id-00038,1,Astrology,"<p>A star watcher studies a symbolic language of the heavens known as astrology. Equal parts art form and science, astrology can be used to read the future and affect it in subtle ways. Much like an alchemist or investigator, a star watcher collects formulae in a formula book. However, the formulae resemble star charts, and unlike alchemists or normal investigators, he uses these formulae along with personal details and astronomical measurements to make horoscopes-magical calculations stored much like scrolls-in which he can store spells. In many ways, the star watcher's horoscopes function like extracts, with the following exceptions.</p><p>A star watcher's horoscope is always keyed to a specific creature that must be willing and present when the star watcher prepares the horoscope. Only the creature to which a horoscope is keyed can activate it and be affected by it. A horoscope is 'cast' by reading it as a standard action, though a star watcher can draw and read a horoscope as a single standard action.</p><p>A star watcher doesn't gain a competence bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks to create alchemical items, and he cannot identify potions with that skill. Furthermore, a star watcher cannot select alchemist discoveries as investigator talents. A star watcher can study a wizard's spellbook or alchemist's formula book to learn formulae, but a star watcher's formula book is too esoteric for anyone except another star watcher to learn spells from.</p>",icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp
,Investigator,"[[""Investigator""],[""Holomog Demolitionist""]]",Investigator (Holomog Demolitionist),Holomog Demolitionist,<id-00008,6,Battlefield Preparation,"<p>At 6th level, the investigator can create 10 feet of difficult terrain by spending a full-round action to analyze and manipulate his surroundings. This terrain can be in any shape designated by the investigator, but at least 1 square must be adjacent to his position. For every 4 levels he has beyond 6th, the investigator can create an additional 10 feet of difficult terrain, to a maximum of 40 feet at 18th level. This is a physical alteration that remains in place until the surface is altered again (the road is repaved, the floor repaired, etc.), and the Holomog demolitionist ignores the effects of any difficult terrain he creates in this way.</p><p>At 10th level, the Holomog demolitionist can use this ability to create clouds of dust and rubble that create concealment rather than difficult terrain in the same area. This concealment lasts 1d4 rounds plus 1 round for every 4 investigator levels, and the Holomog demolitionist is affected by the concealment as normal.</p><p>At 14th level, the difficult terrain the Holomog demolitionist creates provides cover for himself and his allies.</p>",icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp
,Investigator,"[[""Investigator""],[""Forensic Physician""]]",Investigator (Forensic Physician),Forensic Physician,<id-00017,5,Blood Lore,"<p>At 5th level, a forensic physician can study a sample of blood and learn about its origins by attempting a Heal check with a DC of 20 for a creature very familiar to the forensic physician (generally common PC races for a PC forensic physician), 25 if the creature is somewhat familiar to the forensic physician (typically a commonly known monster, but not the subject of many investigations), and 30 or more for rarer creatures. This allows the forensic physician to identify the race of creature that spilled the blood, and the creature's age and gender (if any).</p><p>If the forensic physician succeeds at the Heal check but might not have heard of the creature's race before, he can attempt an automatic Knowledge check to see if he knows about the creature. If he succeeds, he identifies the blood (and gains all other benefits of the Knowledge check); otherwise, he knows that he succeeded at the Heal check but the blood is not from a creature he recognizes. If the blood is in its original setting, and the forensic physician exceeds the DC by 5 or more, he can study the blood to determine a rough estimate of when the blood was shed, and he can study the bloodstain patterns to get an approximate idea of how the creatures involved were positioned and moving.</p>",icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp
,Investigator,"[[""Investigator""],[""Profiler""]]",Investigator (Profiler),Profiler,<id-00036,4,Blood Sleuth,"<p>At 4th level, a profiler can expend one use of his inspiration to use discern next of kin as a spell-like ability. Alternatively, he can expend two uses of inspiration to use blood biography as a spell-like ability.</p>",icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp
,Investigator,"[[""Investigator""],[""Empiricist""]]",Investigator (Empiricist),Empiricist,<id-00005,2,Ceaseless Observation,"<p>An empiricist's ability to notice the minutiae of almost everything that happens around him allows him to make shrewd and insightful calculations about people and even inanimate objects. At 2nd level, an empiricist uses his Intelligence modif ier instead of the skill's typical ability for all Disable Device, Perception, Sense Motive, and Use Magic Device checks. He can also use his Intelligence modifier instead of Charisma on any Diplomacy checks made to gather information. This ability replaces poison lore and poison resistance.</p>",icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp
,Investigator,"[[""Investigator""],[""Jinyiwei""]]",Investigator (Jinyiwei),Jinyiwei,<id-00025,3,Celestial Insight,"<p>At 3rd level, a jinyiwei learns to see through the types of magic that often lead others astray. She gains a +1 competence bonus on saving throws to resist enchantment and illusion effects. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>",icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp
,Investigator,"[[""Investigator""],[""Spiritualist""]]",Investigator (Spiritualist),Spiritualist,<id-00002,1,Commune with Spirits,"<p>Instead of relying on alchemical research to find clues, a spiritualist relies on communion with the world beyond death. At 1st level, a spiritualist gains the ability to use comprehend languages, detect secret doors, and identify, but each has a casting time of 1 minute, as the spiritualist needs to consult with the spirits of the dead that dwell in his area or that are somehow attached to him in some way. The spiritualist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his investigator level + his Wisdom modifier.</p><p>As he goes up in level, the spiritualist gains the ability to use other spells with the casting time as above. At 5th level, he can use augury. At 7th level, he can use speak with dead and locate object. At 9th level, he can use legend lore. Each of these requires one use of this ability.</p><p>This ability replaces alchemy. A spiritualist cannot take the alchemist discovery talent or any investigator talent that affects alchemy.</p>",icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp
,Investigator,"[[""Investigator""],[""Ruthless Agent""]]",Investigator (Ruthless Agent),Ruthless Agent,<id-00014,11,Compel Obedience,"<p>At 11th level, a ruthless agent can issue a binding command to a creature as a full-round action once per day. This command acts like geas/quest with the creature as the target, using the ruthless agent's investigator level as the caster level. The ruthless agent can compel obedience from only one creature at a time (as soon as the geas/quest is fulfilled, however, the ruthless agent can use this ability again, as long as she has a use of this ability available).</p><p>At 17th level, the ruthless agent can compel obedience from two creatures at once, and she is always aware of the targets as if they were under the effects of a status spell (caster level = the ruthless agent's investigator level).</p>",icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp

,Investigator,"[[""Investigator""],[""Engineer""]]",Investigator (Engineer),Engineer,<id-00004,1,Custom Mechanism,"<p>An engineer can create a mechanism, a small device that assists with the execution of an activity. Creating a mechanism requires 1 minute of time and expends 1 use from the engineer's inspiration pool. An engineer chooses a skill to associate with the mechanism when he creates it. As an immediate action, a mechanism can be activated to grant the engineer's inspiration die on a check of the associated skill. An engineer can create a mechanism that affects attack rolls or saving throws, but she expends 2 uses from her inspiration pool to do so. Any creature can use a mechanism, but a creature can have only 1 mechanism at a time, as multiple mechanisms interfere with each other while in close proximity. A mechanism remains active for a number of minutes equal to the engineer's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).

At 1st level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, a majordomo gains a bonus teamwork feat. As a standard action, she can grant all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear her one of these teamwork feats (even if they don't meet the prerequisites) for a number of rounds equal to 3 + her investigator level. She can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus an additional time at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p><p>At 4th level, a majordomo can use her delegate ability and designate a single noncombat task that could make use of the teamwork feat (for instance, designating the Cooperative CraftingAPG feat and a session of crafting). As long as the allies pursue the task uninterrupted, instead of experiencing the benefits for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the majordomo's investigator level, her allies retain the benefits until the task is complete, to a maximum of 8 hours. Additionally, the majordomo can use her delegate ability as a move action instead of a standard action.</p><p>At 7th level, a majordomo can use her delegate ability to grant two teamwork feats to her allies, instead of one feat.

To do so, he starts from a place where he knows that the creature has been and why (most often the scene of a crime) and attempts a Sense Motive check against a DC equal to 40 or to 20 + the creature's Bluff modifier, whichever is higher, which the GM rolls in secret. On a failure, the profiler's guess about the creatures movements is inaccurate. On a success, the profiler is able to track the creature's general movements as if using Survival to track (though the usual modifiers on Survival checks to track don't apply, and this ability allows her to track a creature using pass without trace or otherwise leaving no trail). After at most 1 hour (or sooner if there are many possible options for the creature to take, at the GM's discretion), if the profiler has not yet found further evidence of the creature's passing (such as footprints, fingerprints, or any other indication that the creature came this way), he loses track of the creature's movements; if he does, he can try to guess where the creature went next by attempting another check.</p>",icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp
