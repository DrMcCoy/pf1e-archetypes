A wild child can begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. The wild child uses his brawler level as his effective druid level for determining the abilities of his animal companion. This ability replaces the bonus combat feats gained at 2nd, 8th, 14th, and 20th levels.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Living Avalanche""]]",Brawler (Living Avalanche),Living Avalanche,<id-00003,16,Avalanche,"<p>At 16th level, a living avalanche can attempt to overrun multiple creatures as a full-round action. The living avalanche moves up to twice her speed in a straight line and attempts an overrun combat maneuver against each creature in her path, as long as that creature is no more than two size categories larger than herself. Each creature she succeeds against is knocked prone and takes damage as if the living avalanche hit it with a close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike. If she fails her combat maneuver check against a creature, she stops her movement in the space directly in front of the creature.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Bouncer""]]",Brawler (Bouncer),Bouncer,<id-00004,5,Bar Fight Mastery,"<p>At 5th level, in addition to the benefits of close weapon mastery, when a bouncer confirms a critical hit against a major participant in a bar fight, she also reduces the tenacity of the crowd by her normal brawling damage amount (this amount isn't doubled).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Ulfen Beast-Wrestler""]]",Brawler (Ulfen Beast-Wrestler),Ulfen Beast-Wrestler,<id-00007,4,Beast Defenses,"<p>At 4th level, when facing enemies she selected with beast training, the beast-wrestler gains a bonus to AC equal to 1/2 her beast training bonus against that creature.

The only humanoid subtype the beast-wrestler can select is giant. She gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to her CMD against creatures of the type she selected.</p><p>At 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, the Ulfen beast-wrestler can select an additional type of creature. In addition, at each such interval the bonuses against any one type of creature she's chosen (including the one just selected, if so desired) increase by 2. If a specific creature falls into more than one category, the beast-wrestler's bonuses don't stack; she simply uses whichever bonus is higher. This ability replaces maneuver training.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg

At 13th level, the enhancement bonus to her base speed increases to +15 feet and she gains the scent ability within 30 feet. At 18th level, her climb speed increases to 30 feet, and the enhancement bonus to her base speed increases to +20 feet. This ability replaces AC bonus.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Constructed Pugilist""]]",Brawler (Constructed Pugilist),Constructed Pugilist,<id-00010,2,Bonus Combat Feat,"<p>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p><p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p><p>At 2nd level, a constructed pugilist adds Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Master Craftsman (Craft [weapons]), and Skill Focus (Craft [weapons]) to the list of bonus feats she can choose (instead of just combat feats).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Exemplar""]]",Brawler (Exemplar),Exemplar,<id-00011,1,Call to Arms,"<p>At 1st level, an exemplar can expend a use of martial flexibility to rouse her allies into action. All allies within 30 feet are no longer flat-footed, even if they are surprised. Using this ability is a move action. At 6th level, the exemplar can use it as a swift action instead. At 10th level, she can use it as a free action. At 12th level, she can use it as an immediate action. This ability replaces unarmed strike and close weapon mastery.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Shield Champion""]]",Brawler (Shield Champion),Shield Champion,<id-00022,15,Champion Defense,"<p>At 15th level, once per day when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat from a weapon, unarmed, or natural attack, the shield champion can attempt to absorb all the damage with her shield. To use this ability, the shield champion must attempt a Fortitude saving throw, with the DC equal to the damage dealt. If it succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; otherwise, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to use this ability-if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. At 19th level, she can use this ability twice per day. This ability replaces the maneuver training gained at 15th and 19th levels.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Constructed Pugilist""]]",Brawler (Constructed Pugilist),Constructed Pugilist,<id-00028,1,Constructed Limb,"<p>A constructed pugilist begins play with a special prosthetic limb built for fighting and typically made of iron, steel, stone, or wood, with the corresponding hardness and hit points (see Table 7-13). She treats attacks with this limb as unarmed strikes that gain all the benefits of the brawler's unarmed strike class feature. She treats the limb as a light weapon and is proficient with it. Removing or reattaching the constructed limb takes 10 minutes.</p><p>The constructed pugilist can improve her constructed limb as if it were a normal melee weapon. For the purpose of rebuilding the limb as a masterwork weapon, rebuilding the limb out of a special material, or adding certain magical special abilities to it, the limb counts as a one-handed melee weapon that costs 60 gp and weighs 6 pounds-though it is specially fitted to the constructed pugilist and can't be resold or used by anyone else. A constructed limb can benefit from either its own enhancement bonus and special abilities or those granted by an amulet of mighty fists, but if it would benefit from both simultaneously, it benefits only from the source with the higher effective enhancement bonus (the limb benefits from its own abilities in the case of a tie).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Bouncer""]]",Brawler (Bouncer),Bouncer,<id-00028,1,Crowd Control,"<p>When in a bar fight, a bouncer has her tenacity reduced by the crowd at the end of a round by the minimum possible amount. In addition, when she takes the mix it up action, she reduces the tenacity of the crowd by an additional amount equal to her brawler level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Battle Dancer""]]",Brawler (Battle Dancer),Battle Dancer,<id-00014,1,Dancer's Cunning,"<p>A battle dancer can treat her Charisma score as her Intelligence score for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats. In addition, she can attempt a Perform (dance) check instead of a Bluff check to feint in combat, and her unarmed strikes are considered to have the performance weapon special quality.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Battle Dancer""]]",Brawler (Battle Dancer),Battle Dancer,<id-00007,4,Dancing Dodge,"<p>At 4th level, when an opponent attempts a melee attack against a battle dancer, the battle dancer can expend one use of an attack of opportunity as an immediate action to move 5 feet, granting the battle dancer a dodge bonus to AC equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0) against the triggering attack. The attack is still resolved normally, even if the battle dancer's movement takes her out of the triggering attack's reach. This movement is not a 5-foot step and provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one that triggered this ability, though the battle dancer can attempt an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking the attacks. A battle dancer can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half her level. She can use this ability only while wearing light armor or no armor, and while carrying no heavier than a light load.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Bouncer""]]",Brawler (Bouncer),Bouncer,<id-00032,2,Drunk Handler,"<p>At 2nd level, a bouncer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate and Sense Motive checks against foes that are tipsy or worse. In addition, when in a bar fight, she ignores damage reduction against nonlethal damage her targets have from being drunk or worse.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Bouncer""]]",Brawler (Bouncer),Bouncer,<id-00033,4,Drunk Knockout,"<p>At 4th level, a bouncer can use one use of her knockout ability to attempt a similar maneuver in a bar fight against a major participant who is drunk or worse. She must declare her intent before attempting her brawling check, and if she hits and reduces the target's tenacity, that target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the bouncer's brawler level + the higher of the bouncer's Strength or Dexterity modifiers) or immediately be reduced to 0 tenacity.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Living Avalanche""]]",Brawler (Living Avalanche),Living Avalanche,<id-00010,2,Earth Discipline,"<p>At 2nd level, a living avalanche gains Improved Overrun as a bonus feat, even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites. At 5th level, she gains Improved Bull Rush as a bonus feat, even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Steel-Breaker""]]",Brawler (Steel-Breaker),Steel-Breaker,<id-00005,5,Exploit Weakness,"<p>At 5th level, as a swift action a steel-breaker can observe a creature or object to find its weak point by succeeding at a Wisdom check, adding her brawler level against a DC of 10 + the object's hardness or the target's CR. If it succeeds, the steel-breaker gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls until the end of her turn, and any attacks she makes until the end of her turn ignore the creature or object's DR or hardness.</p><p>A steel-breaker can instead use this ability as a swift action to analyze the movements and expressions of one creature within 30 feet, granting a bonus on Sense Motive checks and Reflex saving throws, as well as a dodge bonus to AC against that opponent equal to 1/2 her brawler level until the start of her next turn. This ability replaces brawler's strike.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Turfer""]]",Brawler (Turfer),Turfer,<id-00008,3,Favored Turf,"<p>At 3rd level, a turfer chooses a type of terrain from the ranger's favored terrain list. When in that type of terrain, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD.</p><p>At 7th level and every 4 brawler levels thereafter, the turfer chooses an additional terrain in which to gain these bonuses. Each time, in one selected terrain (including the one just chosen), her bonus on initiative checks increases by 2, and her bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD increases by 1.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Feral Striker""]]",Brawler (Feral Striker),Feral Striker,<id-00013,1,Feral Aspect,"<p>This functions as the shifter aspect class feature of the shifter, except the feral striker can choose only from the bear, bull, falcon, snake, stag, tiger, and wolf aspects. She has access to only the minor versions all these aspects.</p><p>At 6th level, the feral striker can take on two minor aspects simultaneously as a move action. Each aspect counts toward her total number of minutes (so if a feral striker who normally has 9 total minutes of aspects takes on two aspects simultaneously for 4 minutes, she still has 1 minute remaining). She can end one or both aspects as a free action on her turn.</p><p>At 10th level, the feral shifter adds her Constitution modifier to the total number of minutes per day in which she can use feral aspect.</p><p>At 12th level, the feral striker can take on three aspects simultaneously as a move action or one or two aspects as a swift action.</p><p>At 20th level, the feral striker can take on as many aspects as she wishes at once as a swift action, and they count as only one aspect for the purpose of calculating duration.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Exemplar""]]",Brawler (Exemplar),Exemplar,<id-00005,5,Field Instruction,"<p>At 5th level, as a standard action an exemplar can grant a teamwork feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. This teamwork feat must be one the exemplar knows or has gained with the martial flexibility ability. Allies retain the use of this teamwork feat for 3 rounds + 1 round for every 2 brawler levels. If the granted teamwork feat is one gained from martial flexibility, this duration ends immediately if the exemplar loses access to that feat. Allies don't need to meet the prerequisites of this teamwork feat. The exemplar can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day at 9th, 12th, and 17th level. This ability otherwise counts as the cavalier's tactician class feature; feats and other effects which affect tactician (such as Practiced Tactician) apply to it. This ability replaces brawler's strike.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Verdant Grappler""]]",Brawler (Verdant Grappler),Verdant Grappler,<id-00010,2,Green Grasp,"<p>At 2nd level, a verdant grappler gains Improved Grapple as a bonus feat. At 3rd level, she must choose grapple as her first combat maneuver for maneuver training. When she pins a creature, she can cause roots and vines to burst from the ground (no matter the surrounding terrain), allowing the verdant grappler to attempt to tie up the creature without needing to retrieve rope or use a hand to hold the rope; as usual, a tied-up creature is pinned and not helpless. The verdant grappler must remain within 30 feet of the tied-up creature, or the vines automatically release it. She can tie up only one creature at a time with green grasp.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Wild Child""]]",Brawler (Wild Child),Wild Child,<id-00004,5,Hunter's Tricks,"<p>At 5th level, a wild child can expend a use of martial flexibility to use a trick from the ranger skirmisher archetype. Each time he activates this ability, the wild child can use a different hunter trick. He cannot choose any tricks that rely on ranged attacks. Activating this ability is not an action, but using the trick might require the wild child to use an action of a different type. This ability replaces close weapon mastery.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Living Avalanche""]]",Brawler (Living Avalanche),Living Avalanche,<id-00002,20,Improved Avalanche,"<p>At 20th level, if a living avalanche rolls a natural 20 on an overrun combat maneuver check as part of the avalanche ability, she can immediately attempt to confirm the critical hit by attempting another combat maneuver check with the same modifiers as the previous one; if the critical hit is confirmed, the attack deals double damage.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Hinyasi""]]",Brawler (Hinyasi),Hinyasi,<id-00004,5,Improvisation Mastery,"<p>At 5th level, a hinyasi picks one type of improvised weapon (light, onehanded, or two-handed) and gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with that type of weapon.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg

,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Hinyasi""]]",Brawler (Hinyasi),Hinyasi,<id-00006,4,Improvised Maneuver,"<p>At 4th level, a hinyasi learns to confound and befuddle her opponents with improvised weapons. She chooses one of the following combat maneuvers: bull rush, drag, disarm, sunder, reposition, or trip. When she hits an opponent with an improvised weapon, the hinyasi can perform her chosen combat maneuver against the same target as a free action. She takes a -4 penalty on the combat maneuver check, and she can't attempt an improvised maneuver check more than once per round. This combat maneuver still provokes attacks of opportunity unless the hinyasi has a feat or ability that allows her to perform it without provoking attacks of opportunity.</p><p>At 10th level, she chooses a second combat maneuver that she can use with this ability, though she can still perform only one improvised maneuver per round. At 16th level, she chooses a third, though she can still perform only one improvised maneuver per round.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Exemplar""]]",Brawler (Exemplar),Exemplar,<id-00008,3,Inspiring Prowess,"<p>At 3rd level, an exemplar gains the ability to use certain bardic performances.

These modifications do not require the constructed pugilist to rebuild her constructed limb.</p><p><i>Flex Limb: </i>The limb is divided into jointed segments held in place with rigid rods. As a standard action, the constructed pugilist can release the rods and turn her limb into a whiplike appendage. In this mode, the prosthesis can be used to make trip attempts, and it grants a +2 bonus on disarm attempts made using it. The constructed pugilist doesn't run the risk of dropping her limb if she fails. Returning the limb to its rigid form takes a standard action. As a standard action, a constructed pugilist with both flex limb and limb extender can activate or deactivate one of those limb modifications or both simultaneously; when the constructed pugilist has both flex limb and limb extender activated, she gains the benefits of reach with the flex limb abilities.</p><p><i>Grapnel Arm: </i>The constructed pugilist can fire a grappling hook built into her prosthesis. The grappling hook is attached to a 40-foot-long fine chain affixed to the limb. The constructed pugilist can attack with the grappling hook as a standard action, making a ranged touch attack against the target. The grappling hook can't be used as part of a full attack. On a successful hit, the grappling hook deals no damage, but it functions as though it had the grapple weapon special feature (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 22), except it requires only a hit (not a critical hit) and the grapple ends if the constructed pugilist moves more than 40 feet away from the grappled creature. The constructed limb can't be used to make melee attacks until the grappling hook has been reloaded (a standard action).</p><p><i>Limb Extender: </i>As a standard action, the constructed pugilist can activate an extender, giving her limb the reach weapon special feature. Returning the limb to its normal length is a standard action.</p><p><i>Shielding Limb: </i>The constructed pugilist learns to block blows with her mechanical limb. She gains a +2 shield bonus to AC, though she loses this bonus anytime she loses her Dexterity bonus to AC.</p><p><i>Tight Grip: </i>Special tensors allow the constructed pugilist to lock her grip in place. When using her constructed limb, the constructed pugilist gains a +1 bonus on Climb checks and combat maneuver checks to disarm and grapple, as well as to her CMD against attempts to disarm items held in the limb. This modification can be chosen only if the limb includes a hand or other gripping appendage.</p><p><i>Vicious Blades: </i>Razor-sharp blades on the surface of the limb cause it to deal bludgeoning and slashing damage and increase its critical threat range to 19-20. A constructed pugilist who has the vicious spikes limb modification can't select this modification.</p><p><i>Vicious Spikes: </i>Long spikes protrude from the limb, causing it to deal bludgeoning and piercing damage and increasing its critical multiplier to x3.

If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p><p>Whenever the wild child chooses a new maneuver for this ability, his animal companion also learns a trick to make use of this combat maneuver. For example, if the wild child chooses maneuver training (dirty trick), his animal companion also learns a trick that allows it to use the dirty trick combat maneuver. He cannot choose any tricks that rely on ranged attacks. This bonus trick doesn't count against the animal companion's total tricks known and does not take any time or checks to train. Should the wild child gain a new animal companion (such as if the previous one dies), this new animal companion begins with the same number of bonus tricks.

This functions as an alchemist's mutagen and uses the brawler's class level as her alchemist level for this ability (alchemist levels stack with brawler levels for determining the effect of this ability). A mutagenic mauler counts as an alchemist for the purpose of imbibing a mutagen prepared by someone else.</p><p>At 6th level, a mutagenic mauler gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when she attacks in melee while in her mutagenic form.

At 8th level, if the winding path renegade begins her turn with the grappled condition, she can deal 2d6 points of fire damage to all other creatures in the grapple as a free action. At 14th level, the winding path renegade becomes as difficult to contain as a flame. Once per day as a full-round action, she can transform into liquid flame, instantly escaping all bonds as if under the effect of freedom of movement and moving up to her speed. When moving as part of this ability, she can move through creatures' squares freely and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. She deals 10d6 points of fire damage to any creature whose square she enters during this movement.

At 8th level, she can harness the power of the wind to make enormous leaps. As a move action, she can leap without attempting an Acrobatics check, jumping any distance up to her speed (upward movement counts as double, as when flying). She can leap in this way a number of times per day equal to her class level. At 14th level, when using the Deflect Arrows feat, the winding path renegade can send one projectile back at her attacker, using the same attack roll and damage roll the attacker rolled against her.

This works like the sleeper hold ability, but imposes a -5 penalty on her grapple combat maneuver check. If the opponent succeeds at its Fortitude save, the strangler deals damage as if she had attempted the grapple check to damage her opponent; if the opponent fails its Fortitude save, it dies.

,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Shield Champion""]]",Brawler (Shield Champion),Shield Champion,<id-00005,5,Returning Shield,"<p>At 5th level, a shield champion can throw a shield so it ricochets off her target (and possibly other solid objects) to return to her at the end of her turn. This ability functions whether or not the shield champion hits her opponent or moves on her turn. The shield deals no damage to targets it bounces off other than the original target of the shield champion's attack. Other circumstances can prevent the shield from returning to the shield champion, such as an opponent using a readied action to catch the shield, or the shield sticking to a mimic's adhesive. The shield champion can opt to not have a thrown shield return to her, in which case it falls to the ground as it normally would. If the shield has the returning weapon special ability, she can use either that or this ability.</p><p>If a shield champion has additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, these additional attacks can be ricochets off an earlier target. The distance to each additional target adds to the total range of the shield, and range penalties apply, but there are no additional penalties for attacking in this manner. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, effects and modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as true strike) only apply to the first attack and not to the others. A shield champion can throw a shield as part of a brawler's flurry.</p><p>At 9th level, a shield champion gains Greater Shield Focus as a bonus feat. She must meet all prerequisites before selecting that feat. At 12th level, a shield champion can use her unarmed strike damage when dealing damage with a shield (whether in melee or thrown) or the shield's damage, whichever is greater. At 17th level, by ricocheting her shield off a nearby surface before hitting your intended target, she can treat that surface as the origin square of the attack to determine whether the target is flanked and whether the target gains a cover bonus to its AC. She can use this ability to attack a creature with total concealment from her if she knows what square it occupies, but the attack still has a 50% miss chance.

If she is unable to move 5 feet, she can't attempt any further attacks or combat maneuvers. She can't exceed her maximum speed. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity if the brawler would be able to take a 5-foot step normally; if she would be unable to (for instance, if she were in difficult terrain), the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless she succeeds at the appropriate Acrobatics checks.

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.

Creatures that do not need to breathe, are immune to critical hits, or are immune to nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, a strangler can use this ability twice per day.

If she is able to feint as a move action (such as from having the Improved Feint feat), she can combine a move action to move with her feint. At 11th level, once per round she can declare her square and one adjacent square as the origin of her attacks until her next turn (allowing her to use one or both squares to determine whether she or allies are flanking an opponent).

If the shield has the returning weapon special ability, she can use either that or this ability.</p><p>If a shield champion has additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, these additional attacks can be ricochets off an earlier target. The distance to each additional target adds to the total range of the shield, and range penalties apply, but there are no additional penalties for attacking in this manner. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, effects and modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as true strike) only apply to the first attack and not to the others. A shield champion can throw a shield as part of a brawler's flurry.</p><p>At 9th level, a shield champion gains Greater Shield Focus as a bonus feat. She must meet all prerequisites before selecting that feat. At 12th level, a shield champion can use her unarmed strike damage when dealing damage with a shield (whether in melee or thrown) or the shield's damage, whichever is greater. At 17th level, by ricocheting her shield off a nearby surface before hitting your intended target, she can treat that surface as the origin square of the attack to determine whether the target is flanked and whether the target gains a cover bonus to its AC. She can use this ability to attack a creature with total concealment from her if she knows what square it occupies, but the attack still has a 50% miss chance. This ability replaces brawler's strike.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Battle Dancer""]]",Brawler (Battle Dancer),Battle Dancer,<id-00028,2,Rolling Flurry,"<p>When a battle dancer uses her brawler's flurry, she must move 5 feet before each melee attack or combat maneuver. If she is unable to move 5 feet, she can't attempt any further attacks or combat maneuvers. She can't exceed her maximum speed. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity if the brawler would be able to take a 5-foot step normally; if she would be unable to (for instance, if she were in difficult terrain), the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless she succeeds at the appropriate Acrobatics checks. While using this ability, she can still take her normal 5-foot step before or after making her attacks.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Winding Path Renegade""]]",Brawler (Winding Path Renegade),Winding Path Renegade,<id-00028,2,School Focus,"<p>At 2nd level, a winding path renegade continues the training she left behind, gaining the benefits of the mystery taught at her old monastery. As the winding path renegade progresses in her self-guided training, she gains a deeper understanding of her chosen monastery's mystery, which grants her new powers.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Strong-Side Boxer""]]",Brawler (Strong-Side Boxer),Strong-Side Boxer,<id-00007,1,Shield-Hand,"<p>A strong-side boxer can use her off hand as if it were a buckler, gaining a +1 natural armor bonus to her AC as long as she does not use her off hand to make attacks. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. While using her off hand in this manner, the strong-side boxer treats that hand as a buckler for the purposes of other feats and abilities (though she is also considered to have a free hand).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Strangler""]]",Brawler (Strangler),Strangler,<id-00006,4,Sleeper Hold,"<p>At 4th level, a strangler can instantly render a pinned opponent unconscious. This works like the knockout ability, but requires a successful grapple combat maneuver check against the pinned opponent and does not have to damage the opponent. Creatures that do not need to breathe, are immune to critical hits, or are immune to nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, a strangler can use this ability twice per day. At 16th level, she can use it three times per day. This alters knockout.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Snakebite Striker""]]",Brawler (Snakebite Striker),Snakebite Striker,<id-00008,3,Snake Feint,"<p>At 3rd level, a snakebite striker who uses a standard action to move can combine that move with a feint. If she is able to feint as a move action (such as from having the Improved Feint feat), she can combine a move action to move with her feint. At 11th level, once per round she can declare her square and one adjacent square as the origin of her attacks until her next turn (allowing her to use one or both squares to determine whether she or allies are flanking an opponent). At 15th level, she counts an additional adjacent square for this purpose. This ability replaces maneuver training gained at 3rd and 7th levels.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Snakebite Striker""]]",Brawler (Snakebite Striker),Snakebite Striker,<id-00013,1,Sneak Attack,"<p>At 1st level, the snakebite striker can make a sneak attack. This is as the rogue ability of the same name. At 1st level, her sneak attack damage is +1d6. This increases by 1d6 at 6th, 10th, 12th, and 20th levels. If she gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack. This ability replaces martial flexibility.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Battle Dancer""]]",Brawler (Battle Dancer),Battle Dancer,<id-00006,4,Sparring Partners,"<p>At 4th level, once per day when a battle dancer gains a flanking bonus on an attack while using her rolling flurry ability, the ally providing the flank gains a flanking bonus on its next attack against that opponent, even if the battle dancer moves out of a flanking position. If either the opponent or the ally moves more than 5 feet before the ally's attack, the flanking bonus is lost. This ability works only if the ally is on the opposite side of an opponent during the battle dancer's attack, not if a flanking bonus is gained in some other way, such as through Gang Up. A battle dancer can use this ability one additional time per day at 10th level and at 16th level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Strangler""]]",Brawler (Strangler),Strangler,<id-00011,1,Strangle,"<p>At 1st level, a strangler deals +1d6 sneak attack damage whenever she succeeds at a grapple check to damage or pin an opponent. The strangler is always considered flanking her target for the purpose of using this ability. This damage increases by +1d6 at 2nd, 8th and 15th levels. This ability replaces unarmed strike and brawler's flurry.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Strong-Side Boxer""]]",Brawler (Strong-Side Boxer),Strong-Side Boxer,<id-00031,1,Strong-Side Fist,"<p>A strong-side boxer can spend 1 minute to wrap one of her hands in rope or cord. The strong-side boxer can carry items or wield weapons in a wrapped hand, but she takes a -2 penalty on Dexteritybased skill checks that requires the use of that hand (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks). Unwrapping a hand is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. At 3rd level, as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a strong-side boxer can dip her wrapped hand in resin and then crushed glass or small metal spikes, which remain on her wrapped hand for 1 hour. If she chooses crushed glass, she can deal slashing damage with her unarmed strikes; if she chooses spikes, she can deal piercing damage with her unarmed strikes for the duration. Whether she chooses crushed glass or metal spikes, she deals an additional 1 point of bleed damage with her unarmed strikes. At 7th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d4. At 11th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d6. At 15th level, the bleed damage increases to 2d4. At 19th level, the bleed damage is multiplied on a critical hit. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with bleed damage from other sources.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Steel-Breaker""]]",Brawler (Steel-Breaker),Steel-Breaker,<id-00028,3,Sunder Training,"<p>At 3rd level, a steel-breaker receives additional training in sunder combat maneuvers. She gains a +2 bonus when attempting a sunder combat maneuver checks and a +2 bonus to her CMD when defending against this maneuver. At 7th level, these bonuses increase by 1, and she gains a +2 bonus on disarm combat maneuver checks and a +2 bonus to her CMD when defending against a disarm maneuver. At 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, all of these bonuses increase by 1. This ability alters maneuver training.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Turfer""]]",Brawler (Turfer),Turfer,<id-00006,4,Terrain Mastery,"<p>At 4th level, a turfer gains the benefits of endure elements and a +10-foot enhancement bonus to her base speed, but only in her favored terrains. In addition, she can move through difficult terrain in her favored terrains at her normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment, but she can't do so through difficult terrain that has been magically manipulated. At 10th and 16th levels, her enhancement bonus to her base speed increases by 10 feet within her favored terrains. The turfer loses this ability if she wears medium or heavy armor or carries a medium or heavy load.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Verdant Grappler""]]",Brawler (Verdant Grappler),Verdant Grappler,<id-00004,5,Thorny Embrace,"<p>At 5th level, when a verdant grappler uses green grasp to tie up a creature, she can have the roots and vines grow vicious thorns that automatically damage the tiedup creature each round at the start of the verdant grappler's turn. The thorns deal damage equal to the base unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower than the verdant grappler.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Shield Champion""]]",Brawler (Shield Champion),Shield Champion,<id-00008,3,Throw Shield,"<p>At 3rd level, a shield champion can throw a heavy or light shield as a normal (nonimprovised) thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet or the shield's range increment, whichever is greater. The thrown shield deals the same damage as a shield bash, and any damage increases from shield spikes apply to this attack. A shield champion is treated as having the Far Shot feat for the purpose of determining range increment penalties for throwing a shield.</p><p>At 7th level, a shield champion can use a thrown shield to perform a bull rush, dirty trick, disarm, reposition, or trip combat maneuver as if she were making a melee shield bash attack. At 11th level, a shield champion gains Shield Master as a bonus feat. She must meet all prerequisites before selecting that feat.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Living Avalanche""]]",Brawler (Living Avalanche),Living Avalanche,<id-00007,4,Unyielding,"<p>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p><p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
,Brawler,"[[""Brawler""],[""Venomfist""]]",Brawler (Venomfist),Venomfist,<id-00028,1,Venomous Strike,"<p>A venomfist's unarmed strikes deal damage as a creature one size category smaller (1d4 at first level for Medium venomfists). If she hits with her first unarmed strike in a round, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the venomfist's brawler level + her Constitution modifier) or take an additional amount of damage equal to the venomfist's Constitution modifier. The venomfist is immune to this toxin.</p><p>At 4th level, a target that fails this save must succeed at a second saving throw 1 round later or take the same amount of damage again. This effect repeats as long as the target continues to fail its saving throws, to a maximum number of rounds equal to 1 plus 1 additional round for every 4 brawler levels the venomfist has. Unlike other poisons, multiple doses of a venomfist's poison never stack; the more recent poison effect replaces the older one.</p><p>At 5th level, after the venomfist gets 8 hours of rest, she can choose a secondary effect for her venom to impose. She can choose fatigued, shaken, or sickened. A creature that fails its saving throw against her venom also gains the chosen condition until it succeeds at a save against the venom or until the venom's duration ends. Once a creature succeeds at its save against the poison, it becomes immune to the secondary condition for 24 hours, but the attack still deals the extra damage.</p><p>At 10th level, when the venomfist chooses the condition her venom imposes, she can also cause her venom to deal ability score damage each round instead of hit point damage. She chooses Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, and her venom deals 1d3 points of ability score damage each round. In addition, she adds blinded, exhausted, and staggered to the list of secondary effects she can choose for her venom.</p><p>At 16th level, the venomfist's venom is particularly potent. If it fails the initial save, the target must succeed at two consecutive saves before being cured of the venom, though if the first save is successful, the secondary effect ends and the creature is immune to the secondary effects of the venomfist's poison for 24 hours. In addition, the venomfist adds dazed and stunned to the list of secondary effects she can choose for her venom.</p><p>This is a poison effect. The venomfist can't suppress it, but she affects only those she damages with her unarmed strikes (not those she merely touches).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_07.jpg
