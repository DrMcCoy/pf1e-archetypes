,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Agathiel""]]",Vigilante (Agathiel),Agathiel,<id-00015,2,Agathion Blessing,"<p>Beginning at 2nd level, an agathiel gains Aspect of the BeastAPG as a bonus feat while in his vigilante identity. If he selects the claws of the beast option, he can select a bite attack (1d8), a gore attack (1d8), or 2 slam attacks (1d4 each), as appropriate to his animal identity.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp
,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Magical Child""]]",Vigilante (Magical Child),Magical Child,<id-00032,1,Animal Guide,"<p>A magical child starts play with a magical spirit guide in the form of a familiar, using her vigilante level as her effective wizard level. The familiar also has a social identity as a seemingly normal animal, though vigilantes with outlandish familiars might still need to hide the familiar.</p><p>At 3rd level, the magical child's familiar reveals another aspect of its form, and its vigilante identity changes into a creature on the Improved Familiar list that would be available to a 3rd-level spellcaster (the animal guide's social identity always remains as the original normal animal). The familiar can change its vigilante identity again when the magical child reaches 5th and 7th level, each time to familiars available at those levels. The Improved Familiar feat's alignment restrictions apply to this ability, but only the magical child's vigilante identity needs to have an alignment that fulfills the alignment requirements of the improved familiar. The familiar's new vigilante form choices are permanent, and it cannot transform back into its former vigilante identities until 9th level, when the familiar gains the change shape universal monster ability if it doesn't already have it. It can use this ability at will when in its vigilante identity to transform into any of its four vigilante identities. In vigilante form, a magical child's familiar gains an amount of DR/magic equal to her vigilante level. This doesn't stack with any DR/magic that her vigilante form might already possess.</p><p>If a magical child's familiar dies, its consciousness simply leaves its body, and the magical child can replace its body after 24 hours. To do so, she must conduct an 8-hour ritual that costs 200 gp per her vigilante level, but once the ritual is complete, the familiar returns in a new body. It retains all of its memories from its earlier service to the magical child.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp
,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Avenging Beast""]]",Vigilante (Avenging Beast),Avenging Beast,<id-00030,1,Animal Mask,"<p>An avenging beast gains an ornate animal-headed mask that is a focus for his power and must be worn when assuming his vigilante identity. This mask symbolizes one specific animal, and the animal cannot be changed once chosen. Without this mask, an avenging beast cannot assume his vigilante identity. An avenging beast who loses his mask can replace it after 1 week through a specialized ritual that takes 8 hours to complete and costs 200 gp per avenging beast level.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp
,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Masked Maiden""]]",Vigilante (Masked Maiden),Masked Maiden,<id-00012,3,Armor Training,"<p>All Gray Maidens were drilled in the use of their armor, and as a masked maiden continues to lapse in and out of indoctrination, that training emerges slowly from her subconscious. At 3rd level, a masked maiden gains the fighter's armor training class feature, and at 19th level she gains armor mastery. She treats her vigilante level as her fighter level for the purposes of both.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp
,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Faceless Enforcer""]]",Vigilante (Faceless Enforcer),Faceless Enforcer,<id-00015,2,Armored Juggernaut,"<p>At 2nd level, a faceless enforcer does not need help donning half-plate or full-plate armor, but donning it alone takes him 8 minutes. At 4th level, he can don his half-plate or full-plate alone in 4 minutes, and can don it hastily in 2 minutes. At 6th level, he doesn't apply the armor check penalty for any armor on Acrobatics, Escape Artist, or Stealth checks, but the penalty applies on other skill checks as normal. At 8th level, a faceless enforcer can move 5 feet faster than normal in heavy armor, to a maximum of his base speed. At 10th level, it takes him 2 minutes to don heavy armor, 1 minute to don it hastily, and 1 minute to remove it. At 16th level, he can move at full speed in heavy armor. At 18th level, it never takes the vigilante more than 1 minute to don his armor.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp
,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Zealot""]]",Vigilante (Zealot),Zealot,<id-00032,1,Aura,"<p>A zealot of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment (see detect evil spell for details), but only when in his vigilante identity.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp
,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Bellflower Harvester""]]",Vigilante (Bellflower Harvester),Bellflower Harvester,<id-00031,1,Bellflower Crop,"<p>As a standard action, a Bellflower harvester can designate a number of allies equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier as part of his Bellflower crop. Members of a Bellflower crop must remain within 30 feet of the vigilante to gain any benefits from abilities that affect a Bellflower crop, regardless of the ability's source (whether it's a Bellflower harvester, irrigator, or tiller). If the allies leave this range, the Bellflower harvester must designate them again to include them in his crop.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp
,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Agathiel""]]",Vigilante (Agathiel),Agathiel,<id-00031,1,Bestial Identity,"<p>At 1st level, an agathiel's vigilante identity must invoke the appearance and behavior of a single Small or Medium creature of the animal type. The vigilante can attempt to appear to be a normal member of this animal type, but doing so imposes a -10 penalty on his Disguise check. The bonus provided by seamless guise still applies to the vigilante's attempts to appear to be an ordinary animal. Once the vigilante's animal form is selected, it cannot be changed.</p><p>Beginning at 4th level, when an agathiel assumes his vigilante identity, he physically transforms into an animal, though he always retains unusual traits that set him apart from ordinary animals, as if using beast shape I, except the vigilante gains no ability adjustments and can select only a single animal ability from those listed in the spell's description. His social identity remains his true form, and unlike with beast shape I, an agathiel can remain in his animal form indefinitely. The agathiel's vigilante identity is considered a polymorph effect, and while in his vigilante identity, the agathiel is immune to other polymorph effects. Unlike with normal polymorph effects, the agathiel's equipment does not meld into his form, and instead changes shape to fit his animal form and provides the same function, though any equipment requiring hands cannot be used until he returns to his social identity.</p><p>At 8th level, when assuming his vigilante identity, the vigilante can select two abilities provided by beast shape I, or select a single ability provided by beast shape II. At 12th level, he can instead select two abilities provided by beast shape II, or a single ability provided by beast shape III. At 16th level, he can instead select three abilities provided by beast shape III, or a single ability provided by beast shape IV.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp
,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Cabalist""]]",Vigilante (Cabalist),Cabalist,<id-00027,11,Bloody Horror,"<p>At 11th level, when a cabalist casts a spell and one of the targets (or one creature in the area for an area spell) is taking bleed damage, the cabalist can, as a free action, make an Intimidate check to demoralize all targets of the spell (or all creatures in the area for an area spell). The cabalist rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets.</p><p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that cabalist's bloody horror for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp
,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Hangman""]]",Vigilante (Hangman),Hangman,<id-00025,3,Bound to Truth,"<p>At 3rd level, a hangman adds half his vigilante level to his Sense Motive checks to notice lies told by a creature entangled or grappled by his noose, by feeling the creature's throat clench or changes in its breathing. In addition, he can prevent a creature entangled or grappled in his noose from lying by tightening the noose, as per a single-target zone of truth (the caster level equals his vigilante level; the save DC is Charisma-based). He can use the latter ability a number of rounds per day equal to half his vigilante level. These rounds don't need to be consecutive.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp
,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Experimenter""]]",Vigilante (Experimenter),Experimenter,<id-00025,3,Brew Potion,"<p>At 3rd level, an experimenter gains Brew Potion as a bonus feat. He treats his vigilante level as his caster level and can use Craft (alchemy) instead of Spellcraft to brew potions. He can use another potion of the same spell as a sample to provide the necessary spell without consuming the potion, increasing the DC by 5.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp
,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Brute""]]",Vigilante (Brute),Brute,<id-00014,1,Brute Form,"<p>Though it is sometimes difficult to maintain, a brute has a measure of control over his abilities.</p><p>While in his vigilante identity, a brute becomes one size category larger, gaining no ability score adjustments but otherwise gaining all adjustments for his new size, including additional reach, if appropriate. A brute's vigilante identity is savage and dangerous. While in his vigilante identity, the brute takes a -2 penalty to AC, as well as to all ability checks and skill checks that rely on Charisma, Dexterity, or Intelligence. Furthermore, the brute cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting). When a brute is in mortal peril, such as when combat starts, if he is in his social identity, he must succeed at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 his vigilante level) or enter his vigilante identity. Entering his vigilante identity in this way is a horrifying and painful process that takes 1 full round, during which he is flat-footed, and it typically allows his enemies to see his transformation and learn his identity. The brute's vigilante identity can't always tell friend from foe. While he still attacks enemies preferentially during a battle, when there are no more enemies around, each round he must succeed at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 his vigilante level) or continue fighting against his allies or bystanders. Allies can use the aid another action to assist this saving throw with skills like Diplomacy, as they attempt to calm him down. On a successful save, he slowly turns back to his social identity over the course of 1 minute (or shorter if he has a social talent that reduces that time).</p><p>A brute uses his vigilante level as his base attack bonus, but only while he is in his vigilante identity. At 5th level, while in his vigilante identity, the brute gains a +1 bonus on melee attack and damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 13th level and to +3 at 19th level. He uses his normal base attack bonus to qualify for feats and other abilities, although when in his vigilante identity, he uses his increased base attack bonus to determine the effects of feats (such as Power Attack) and other abilities.</p><p>A brute's mundane clothes and armor do not increase in size with him, and any such items he wears while changing into his vigilante identity lose one-quarter of their hit points. Magical clothes and accessories increase in size with the vigilante, however (though his magical armor and weapons initially do not, as normal).</p><p>A brute can stay in his vigilante identity for up to 2 hours at a time, for a total of up to 6 hours in a 24-hour period. When threatened in his vigilante identity, he has the potential to damage bystanders or allies. After switching from his vigilante identity to his social identity, he is fatigued for the same amount of time (rounds, minutes, or hours) that he spent in his vigilante identity and cannot remove or ignore this fatigue by any means except by waiting the appropriate amount of time. If he enters his vigilante identity while fatigued, once he switches back to his social identity, he becomes exhausted for the amount of time he just spent in his vigilante identity, and he also can't remove or ignore the exhaustion by any means other than waiting the appropriate length of time. A character with immunity to fatigue or exhaustion cannot adopt a brute form at all; that immunity prevents the transformation as an effect that would cause fatigue or exhaustion.</p><p>An exhausted brute can only enter his vigilante identity for a number of rounds equal to half his vigilante level (minimum 1); following these rounds, the brute immediately falls unconscious, or into a stupor if he is somehow prevented from falling unconscious. In this state, a brute can be healed as normal (and, if he has 0 hit points or more, he returns to consciousness after receiving any amount of magical healing or a DC 15 Heal check), but he cannot enter his vigilante identity for 1 hour.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp

,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Serial Killer""]]",Vigilante (Serial Killer),Serial Killer,<id-00010,7,Calling Card,"<p>At 7th level, when a serial killer slays a humanoid with a coup de grace or death attack, she can leave a telltale token or clue behind identifying this death as her work. The serial killer chooses her calling card when she gains this ability, and the first time she uses it in an area where she has renown (as per the renown social talent), it becomes associated with her killings. After that, once citizens of a new settlement find this calling card, the serial killer immediately establishes the settlement as an area of renown for her vigilante identity without spending additional time to spread tales, and the Intimidate bonus from renown increases by 2.

At 17th level, as a full-round action, a Dragonscale loyalist can make a full attack and move up to his speed. The loyalist can pause at any point or points during the movement, make one or more of his attacks, and continue moving. Creatures making attacks of opportunity against the loyalist during this movement gain a +4 bonus on their attack and damage rolls. Using this ability counts as using a vigilante talent.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp

,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Bellflower Harvester""]]",Vigilante (Bellflower Harvester),Bellflower Harvester,<id-00032,1,Crop Vigilance,"<p>When the Bellflower harvester uses the aid another action to grant a member of his Bellflower crop a bonus on an attack roll against an opponent, on a skill check, or to AC against an opponent's next attack, the bonus increases to +3. This doesn't stack with the benefits of other feats or class features that improve the bonus he grants to an ally with aid another. At 5th level and every 6 vigilante levels thereafter, the bonus that the Bellflower harvester provides when using aid another to assist a member of his Bellflower crop increases by 1, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level.</p><p>This ability replaces vigilante specialization, but the Bellflower harvester is still treated as if he had the stalker specialization for the purpose of selecting other vigilante talents.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp

He takes no penalties to Disguise checks to appear as the race that matches his current identity. The selection of which race is the social identity and which is the vigilante identity is made at 1st level and cannot be changed. Additionally, when a half-elf double scion switches from one identity to another, he is representing different aspects of his heritage rather than personality. As a result, a half-elf double scion has the same alignment in both of his identities.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp
,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Faceless Enforcer""]]",Vigilante (Faceless Enforcer),Faceless Enforcer,<id-00002,1,Dual Identity,"<p>A faceless enforcer's vigilante identity is tied to a particular helmet or face covering and suit of armor. Switching between identities means donning or removing this armored outfit. Switching identities means entirely donning or removing armor (even if it is donned hastily) and never takes less than the minimum amount of time to do so. How long this takes depends on the type of armor, as detailed on page 153 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Once per month, the vigilante can replace the helmet or face covering and armor associated with his vigilante identity and buy or make a new outfit that becomes tied to that identity. A faceless enforcer cannot select the immediate changeUI or quick changeUI social talents.</p><p>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante's true identity revealed to the world at large.</p><p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante's secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user's appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p><p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante's dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity's alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante's two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p><p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual).

,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Darklantern""]]",Vigilante (Darklantern),Darklantern,<id-00002,1,Dual Identity,"<p>At 1st level, a darklantern can transform into her vigilante identity as a full-round action. When a darklantern switches to her vigilante identity, she undergoes a horrifying transformation from an elf into a drow. After the transformation is complete, the darklantern takes on the appearance of a drow (but otherwise retains her normal facial features and voice) and gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, darkvision with a range of up to 60 feet, and the light blindness universal monster ability. While in her vigilante identity, the darklantern counts as a drow for the purpose of any ability, spell, or magic item targeting drow. A darklantern's vigilante identity must be chaotic evil, but her social identity can be more than one step removed from this alignment.</p><p>Transforming back into the darklantern's social identity requires a move action. However, a darklantern must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + the number of hours she has been in her vigilante identity) in order to successfully transform back into her social identity; otherwise, the move action is wasted and the action cannot be attempted for 1 minute.

He gains a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks against enemies when no other opponents are within 30 feet of him (or the creature he is intimidating).

,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Faceless Enforcer""]]",Vigilante (Faceless Enforcer),Faceless Enforcer,<id-00011,5,Faceless Infiltrator,"<p>At 5th level, when he changes his identity, a faceless enforcer has a third option (instead of social or vigilante) he can assume a fictional identity with no known ties to his Hellknight affiliation, his social identity, or his vigilante identity. When he gains this ability, the faceless enforcer must choose a group, organization, or social structure he wishes to infiltrate (such as the beggars in Egorian's Cheapside or the city's congregation of the Midnight Temple to Asmodeus), and the fictional identity he creates must be a recruit, ally, or prospective employee of that group. This fictional identity's alignment must be within one step from either his vigilante or his social identity. A faceless enforcer can use social and vigilante talents when in his fictional identity, but he risks exposing his secret when he does so.</p><p>When he gains this ability, the faceless enforcer creates mundane records that can verify his fictional identity. While he is in his fictional identity, a faceless enforcer appears to be an otherwise ordinary member of his race, and he receives a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear to be the fictional person he says he is. He must create the appearance for this fictional identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. If the faceless enforcer changes from his vigilante identity to his fictional identity and vice versa, changing identities takes him the normal amount of time to don or remove his armor (see the armored juggernaut ability). If he changes from his fictional identity to his social identity and vice versa, it takes him 1 minute. Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the fictional identity work as normal if the faceless enforcer is in his fictional identity.

Slandering an individual or organization takes 1d4 days in a settlement smaller than a town, or 1 week in a town or larger settlement. The imperial agent must succeed at either a Bluff or Diplomacy check. If the general populace is indifferent towards the target of the slander, the DC of this check is 20 + the target's Charisma modifier. For each step above indifferent the public's attitude towards the target is, the DC increases by 5, and for each step below indifferent the public's attitude towards the target is, the DC decreases by 5. If the imperial agent is successful, the public's attitude toward his target is decreased by 1 step. If the imperial agent fails the check, however, he cannot affect the settlement with this ability for 1 week, and the target of his slander becomes aware that someone is spreading malicious rumors.

If this target is of the proper alignment, the zealot adds his Charisma bonus on his attack rolls (to a maximum of half his vigilante level) and his vigilante level on all damage rolls against the target of his smite. If the target of smite is an outsider with an alignment subtype of the zealot's smite, a similarly aligned dragon, or an undead creature (if the zealot's smite is against evil creatures), a good-aligned cleric or paladin (if the zealot's smite is against good creatures), a chaotic aberration (if the zealot's smite is against chaotic creatures), or a lawful-aligned cleric or paladin (if the zealot's smite is against lawful creatures), the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per vigilante level.

The familiar can change its vigilante identity again when the magical child reaches 5th and 7th level, each time to familiars available at those levels. The Improved Familiar feat's alignment restrictions apply to this ability, but only the magical child's vigilante identity needs to have an alignment that fulfills the alignment requirements of the improved familiar. The familiar's new vigilante form choices are permanent, and it cannot transform back into its former vigilante identities until 9th level, when the familiar gains the change shape universal monster ability if it doesn't already have it. It can use this ability at will when in its vigilante identity to transform into any of its four vigilante identities.

The bonus provided by seamless guise still applies to the vigilante's attempts to appear to be an ordinary animal. Once the vigilante's animal form is selected, it cannot be changed.</p><p>Beginning at 4th level, when an agathiel assumes his vigilante identity, he physically transforms into an animal, though he always retains unusual traits that set him apart from ordinary animals, as if using beast shape I, except the vigilante gains no ability adjustments and can select only a single animal ability from those listed in the spell's description. His social identity remains his true form, and unlike with beast shape I, an agathiel can remain in his animal form indefinitely. The agathiel's vigilante identity is considered a polymorph effect, and while in his vigilante identity, the agathiel is immune to other polymorph effects.

,Vigilante,"[[""Vigilante""],[""Brute""]]",Vigilante (Brute),Brute,<id-00014,1,Brute Form,"<p>Though it is sometimes difficult to maintain, a brute has a measure of control over his abilities.</p><p>While in his vigilante identity, a brute becomes one size category larger, gaining no ability score adjustments but otherwise gaining all adjustments for his new size, including additional reach, if appropriate. A brute's vigilante identity is savage and dangerous. While in his vigilante identity, the brute takes a -2 penalty to AC, as well as to all ability checks and skill checks that rely on Charisma, Dexterity, or Intelligence. Furthermore, the brute cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting). When a brute is in mortal peril, such as when combat starts, if he is in his social identity, he must succeed at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 his vigilante level) or enter his vigilante identity. Entering his vigilante identity in this way is a horrifying and painful process that takes 1 full round, during which he is flat-footed, and it typically allows his enemies to see his transformation and learn his identity. The brute's vigilante identity can't always tell friend from foe. While he still attacks enemies preferentially during a battle, when there are no more enemies around, each round he must succeed at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 his vigilante level) or continue fighting against his allies or bystanders. Allies can use the aid another action to assist this saving throw with skills like Diplomacy, as they attempt to calm him down. On a successful save, he slowly turns back to his social identity over the course of 1 minute (or shorter if he has a social talent that reduces that time).</p><p>A brute uses his vigilante level as his base attack bonus, but only while he is in his vigilante identity. At 5th level, while in his vigilante identity, the brute gains a +1 bonus on melee attack and damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 13th level and to +3 at 19th level. He uses his normal base attack bonus to qualify for feats and other abilities, although when in his vigilante identity, he uses his increased base attack bonus to determine the effects of feats (such as Power Attack) and other abilities.</p><p>A brute's mundane clothes and armor do not increase in size with him, and any such items he wears while changing into his vigilante identity lose one-quarter of their hit points. Magical clothes and accessories increase in size with the vigilante, however (though his magical armor and weapons initially do not, as normal).</p><p>A brute can stay in his vigilante identity for up to 2 hours at a time, for a total of up to 6 hours in a 24-hour period. When threatened in his vigilante identity, he has the potential to damage bystanders or allies. After switching from his vigilante identity to his social identity, he is fatigued for the same amount of time (rounds, minutes, or hours) that he spent in his vigilante identity and cannot remove or ignore this fatigue by any means except by waiting the appropriate amount of time. If he enters his vigilante identity while fatigued, once he switches back to his social identity, he becomes exhausted for the amount of time he just spent in his vigilante identity, and he also can't remove or ignore the exhaustion by any means other than waiting the appropriate length of time. A character with immunity to fatigue or exhaustion cannot adopt a brute form at all; that immunity prevents the transformation as an effect that would cause fatigue or exhaustion.</p><p>An exhausted brute can only enter his vigilante identity for a number of rounds equal to half his vigilante level (minimum 1); following these rounds, the brute immediately falls unconscious, or into a stupor if he is somehow prevented from falling unconscious. In this state, a brute can be healed as normal (and, if he has 0 hit points or more, he returns to consciousness after receiving any amount of magical healing or a DC 15 Heal check), but he cannot enter his vigilante identity for 1 hour.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp

Switching between identities means donning or removing this armored outfit. Switching identities means entirely donning or removing armor (even if it is donned hastily) and never takes less than the minimum amount of time to do so. How long this takes depends on the type of armor, as detailed on page 153 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook.

A zealot must be at least 6th level to select this talent.</p><p>Stalwart (Ex): A zealot with this talent can use mental and physical resilience to avoid certain attacks. If he succeeds at a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he avoids the effect entirely. A helpless zealot doesn't gain the benefit of this ability. A zealot must be 12th level before selecting this talent.</p><p>Stern Gaze (Ex): A zealot with this talent is skilled at sensing deception and intimidating his foes. The zealot gains a morale bonus on all Intimidate and Sense Motive checks equal to half his vigilante level (minimum +1).</p><p>Zealot Smite (Su): Once per day, a zealot with this talent can use this power to smite a foe. Zealots that are good in their vigilante identity (or worship a good deity) can smite evil creatures, those that are evil in their vigilante identity (or worship an evil deity) can smite good creatures, those that are chaotic in their vigilante identity (or worship a chaotic deity) can smite lawful creatures, and those that are lawful in their vigilante identity (or worship a lawful deity) can smite chaotic creatures. A zealot that is neutral when in his vigilante identity and that worships a neutral deity can pick to smite any one of the four alignments; other zealots must select from the alignments available based on their own alignment or their deity's. Once that choice is made, it can't be changed.</p><p>As a swift action, the zealot chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is of the proper alignment, the zealot adds his Charisma bonus on his attack rolls (to a maximum of half his vigilante level) and his vigilante level on all damage rolls against the target of his smite. If the target of smite is an outsider with an alignment subtype of the zealot's smite, a similarly aligned dragon, or an undead creature (if the zealot's smite is against evil creatures), a good-aligned cleric or paladin (if the zealot's smite is against good creatures), a chaotic aberration (if the zealot's smite is against chaotic creatures), or a lawful-aligned cleric or paladin (if the zealot's smite is against lawful creatures), the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per vigilante level. Regardless of the target, the zealot's smite attacks bypass the creature's DR as if it were a weapon with a +5 enhancement bonus.</p><p>At 5th level, and every 3 vigilante levels thereafter, a zealot can smite one additional time per day, to a maximum of seven times per day at 20th level.</p>",icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-brown.webp
