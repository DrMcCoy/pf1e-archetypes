He chooses one type of creature he has selected as a favored enemy, such as 'aberrations.' The ranger selects one ability or feat from the adaptation list for that type (see below). A ranger can use adaptations for 10 minutes per day per ranger level he possesses. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 10-minute increments. If the adaptation requires the ranger to make a more specific choice (such as what skill to use with Skill Focus), this choice is permanent and cannot be changed.</p><p>At 8th, 13th, and 15th-level, the ranger chooses another one of his favored enemy types and selects one adaptation from that type's list, as well as an additional adaptation from any one list of a creature type he's selected (including the one just chosen, if so desired).

Each round of studying terrain is a standard action. During the first round of studying terrain, the battle scout designates a 60-foot-radius-burst area from a single square within line of sight.

(For example, if he spends 2 rounds, he or his allies gain the first two benefits.)</p><p>1st Round: Allies within line of sight and that can hear the battle scout gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks while within the advantageous terrain area.</p><p>2nd Round: Allies within line of sight and that can hear the battle scout gain a +2 on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks while within the advantageous terrain area.</p><p>3rd Round: The battle scout's movement is not hampered by difficult terrain while within the advantageous terrain area.

,Ranger,"[[""Ranger""],[""Beast Master""]]",Ranger (Beast Master),Beast Master,<id-00019,1,Animal Companion,"<p>A beast master forms a close bond with an animal companion. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level - 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks made regarding his animal companion. Unlike a normal ranger, a beast master's choice of animal companion is not limited to a subset of all possibile animal companion choices-he may choose freely among all animal companion choices, just as a druid can.</p><p>The beast master may have more than one animal companion, but he must divide up his effective druid level between his companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a beast master with an effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion. Each time a beast master's effective druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the ranger's service (he must release a companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion). The share spells animal companion ability does not give the ranger the ability to cast a single spell so that it affects all of his animal companions.

The wild hunter can use this ability for 1 minute per day per ranger level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.

At 6th level, he adds Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Net Trickery, and Spring Attack to the list. At 10th level, he adds Greater Two-Weapon Fighting and Improved Precise Shot to the list.

These spells function as divine spells, and are cast and prepared in the same manner as her other ranger spells.</p><p>At 6th level, the raven master selects one 1st-level bard spell of her choice and adds it to her spell list as a 1st-level ranger spell.

This disguise does not take an action to don. He must make a check whenever someone attempts to pick him out from the local citizens. If his check is successful, he blends into the crowd. While not invisible, enemies do not notice his presence and take no actions against him unless they are taking actions against the local citizens in general.

At any time, she can spend 1 minute setting up this ability. Once she has done so, she must stand still, taking no other actions except to keep track of her surroundings; she can't even take free actions like talking. Her heightened senses grant her a supernatural awareness of her surroundings within 20 feet. If any Tiny or larger creature enters the area over which her awareness extends, she automatically knows that it did so (this part of the ability is a divination effect and can't be deceived by spells that block sensory input, only by extreme effects like mind blank). Furthermore, unless that creature is simultaneously negating its visual, auditory, and scent stimuli (such as by being under invisibility, silence, and negate aromaAPG all at once), the sentinel can attempt a Perception check as an immediate action to pinpoint the intruder's location, ignoring any Stealth bonuses the intruder might gain from effects that obscure only one of those senses, such as invisibility, camouflage, or other spells or abilities.</p><p>This sort of heightened analysis of sensory stimuli is taxing, as much so as hustling overland for an equivalent period of time, despite not moving from a single spot.

Furthermore, a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier, the dusk stalker can manipulate shadows in a 5-foot square within 30 feet.
