,Bard,"[[""Bard""],[""Voice of Brigh""]]",Bard (Voice of Brigh),Voice of Brigh,<bardfascinate_1,1,Brigh's Soothing,"<p>At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and capable of paying attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creatures affected. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents this ability from working. For every three levels the bard has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability.Each creature within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and observes the performance for as long as the bard continues to maintain it. While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on all skill checks made as reactions, such as Perception checks. Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new saving throw against the effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect.Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability. Fascinate relies on audible and visual components in order to function.</p>",icons/tools/instruments/harp-lap-brown.webp
,Bard,"[[""Bard""],[""Voice of Brigh""]]",Bard (Voice of Brigh),Voice of Brigh,<bardsoothingperformance_12,12,Brigh's Spark,"<p>At 12th level, a Voice of Brigh can use Brigh's animating spark to reanimate a destroyed construct. The Voice of Brigh selects a destroyed construct within 60 feet and expends 1 round of bardic performance to reanimate the chosen construct. The construct reanimates with a number of hit points equal to the Voice of Brigh's level, but it is staggered. The affected construct follows the Voice of Brigh's orders while reanimated. Each round, the bard can expend another round of bardic performance to keep that construct reanimated for another round. The construct regains a number of hit points equal to the Voice of Brigh's level for every round it remains reanimated. If the construct recovers all of its hit points in this way, it becomes fully reanimated and no longer requires bardic performance to remain animated. A construct fully reanimated in this way follows the orders of the Voice of Brigh that reanimated it, as if the Voice of Brigh were its original creator, for 24 hours. Afterwards, the construct reverts to its original programming. The construct is completely destroyed if the Voice of Brigh ends this performance before the construct regains its full hit points, is interrupted, or is reduced to 0 hit points. A completely destroyed construct cannot be repowered or reanimated, even by another Voice of Brigh. The Voice of Brigh can reanimate multiple constructs with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of bardic performance per reanimated construct per round to maintain the effect.</p>",icons/tools/instruments/harp-lap-brown.webp

A successful Perform check allows the bard to animate and control a 5-foot-cube of water. The watersinger can command the water to take various forms, bend, rise, fall, or sustain a shape, and can make it support weight as if it were solid ice. For example, the watersinger could create a pillar of water (to provide cover), ladder, channel, bridge, stairs, slide, and so on. The manipulated water is as slippery as normal ice. This ability cannot create forms more fragile or complex than what could be carved in normal ice. While under the bard's control, the water has hardness 0 and 3 hit points per inch of thickness. At level 3, the manipulated water gains hardness 1, and this increases by +1 for every 3 bard levels beyond that. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, the volume affected increases by an additional 5-foot cube (these cubes must be adjacent to each other).

The attack can originate from any square of water the bard is manipulating, and the water can get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one, but cannot make attacks of opportunity.
