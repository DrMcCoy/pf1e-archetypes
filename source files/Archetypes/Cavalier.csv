,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Beast Rider""]]",Cavalier (Beast Rider),Beast Rider,<id-00001,1,Exotic Mount,"<p>At 1st level, a beast rider forms a bond with a strong, loyal companion that permits him to ride it as a mount. This mount functions as a druid's animal companion, using the beast rider's level as his effective druid level. The animal chosen as a mount must be large enough to carry the beast rider (Medium or Large for a Small character; Large or Huge for a Medium character).</p><p>The beast rider does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained, and begins play with Endurance as a bonus feat. A beast rider's mount does not gain the share spells special ability.</p><p>Each time the beast rider increases in level, he can choose to select a new, more impressive mount better suited to his increased power.</p><p>Small-sized beast riders can choose a pony or wolf mount at 1st level. At 4th level, a Small beast rider can also choose an allosaurus, ankylosaurus, arsinoitherium, aurochs, bison, boar, brachiosaurus, elephant, glyptodon, hippopotamus, mastodon, megaloceros, riding dog, snapping turtle (giant), triceratops, or tyrannosaurus. At 7th level, he can also choose a dinosaur (deinonychus or velociraptor).</p><p>Medium beast riders can choose a camel or horse mount at 1st level. At 4th level, a Medium beast rider can also choose an allosaurus, ankylosaurus, arsinoitherium, aurochs, bison, brachiosaurus, elephant, glyptodon, hippopotamus, lion, mastodon, megaloceros, snapping turtle (giant), tiger, triceratops, or tyrannosaurus as his mount. Additional mounts might be available with GM approval.</p><p>In addition, a 7th-level or higher Medium beast rider can select any creature whose natural size is Large or Huge, provided that creature is normally available as a Medium-sized animal companion at 7th level (like a bear). To generate statistics for such a mount, apply the following modifications: Size Large; Ability Scores Str +2, Dex -2, Con +2. Increase the damage of each of the mount's natural attacks by one die size. A beast rider cannot choose a mount that is not capable of bearing his weight, that has fewer than four legs, or that has a fly speed (although the GM may allow mounts with a swim speed in certain environments).</p><p>Anytime a feat or ability allows a mount to make a hoof attack, it can make a claw, slam, or other analogous attack instead.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Beast Rider""]]",Cavalier (Beast Rider),Beast Rider,<cavaliercavalierweaponandarmorproficiency_1,1,Weapon and Armor Proficiency,"<p>A beast rider is proficient with light and medium armor, and with shields (with the exception of tower shields).</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Castellan""]]",Cavalier (Castellan),Castellan,<cavaliermount_1,1,Castle Defender,"<p>At 1st level, a castellan gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class and an additional +1 bonus on attack rolls when he is on higher ground. He also gains an additional +1 bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves when he has cover other than soft cover from other creatures. At 6th level, a castellan gains evasion (as a rogue) when he has cover (but not soft cover) against the source of the attack. At 11th level, these bonuses increase by 1. At 16th level, he gains improved evasion instead of evasion. Both the evasion and improved evasion abilities work even when the castellan wears medium or heavy armor. This ability replaces mount.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Castellan""]]",Cavalier (Castellan),Castellan,<cavaliercavalierscharge_3,3,Castle Lore,"<p>At 3rd level, the castellan gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (engineering), Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), Perception, and Stealth checks when he is in urban terrain, including fortifications. A castellan in an urban environment can always act in a surprise round, though he remains flat-footed until he acts. At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the castellan's bonuses on skill and initiative checks increase by 2. This ability replaces cavalier's charge.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Castellan""]]",Cavalier (Castellan),Castellan,<cavalierdemandingchallenge_12,12,Defending Challenge,"<p>At 12th level, the castellan takes no penalty to Armor Class when using his challenge ability.

,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Castellan""]]",Cavalier (Castellan),Castellan,<cavalierexperttrainer_4,4,Guard Companion,"<p>At 4th level, the castellan forms a bond with an animal companion that serves as a guard. While most castellans select birds or canines, the castellan can choose any animal companions available to rangers. This ability functions like the druid nature bond ability, except that the castellan's effective druid level is equal to his cavalier level - 3 and his animal companion doesn't gain the share spells special ability. This ability replaces expert trainer.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Castellan""]]",Cavalier (Castellan),Castellan,<cavaliermightycharge_11,11,Mighty Defense,"<p>At 11th level, when the castellan readies an action to make a melee attack against a creature that is not yet adjacent to him, he doubles the threat range of any melee weapons wielded during the attack. This increase doesn't stack with other effects that increase the threat range of his weapons. In addition, the cavalier can attempt a free dirty trick, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his readied attack is successful. This free combat maneuver doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces mighty charge.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Castellan""]]",Cavalier (Castellan),Castellan,<cavaliersupremecharge_20,20,Supreme Defense,"<p>At 20th level, whenever the castellan readies an action to make a melee attack against a creature that is not yet adjacent to him, his readied attack deals double the normal amount of damage (or triple the damage if using a brace weapon against a charge). In addition, if the cavalier confirms a critical hit on the readied attack, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + the cavalier's class level + the cavalier's Strength modifier) reduces this to being staggered for 1d4 rounds. This ability replaces supreme charge.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Charger""]]",Cavalier (Charger),Charger,<cavalierexperttrainer_4,4,Courser,"<p>At 4th level, a charger's constant training increases his land speed by 10 feet. A charger can also move through up to 10 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. These benefits apply only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the charger's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. These bonuses stack with any other bonuses to the charger's land speed or ability to ignore difficult terrain. This ability replaces expert trainer.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Charger""]]",Cavalier (Charger),Charger,<cavaliermount_1,1,Natural Mount,"<p>A charger counts as having the Mounted Combat feat only for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites, and substitutes the Acrobatics skill for any Ride skill prerequisites when acquiring feats that have Mounted Combat as a prerequisite. Because of his equine form, a charger can wield a lance one-handed as if mounted and deals double damage with a lance while charging. A charger can never gain the benefit of the Mounted Combat feat (or other similar feats or effects, such as Trick Riding) if ridden by another creature. This ability replaces mount.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Charger""]]",Cavalier (Charger),Charger,<cavaliermightycharge_11,11,Ride Down,"<p>At 11th level, a charger can attempt to overrun any number of targets in the path of his charge as a free action. For each successful overrun combat maneuver check, the charger automatically deals an amount of damage to the overrun target equal to that of his hoof attack and can continue with his charge. If any overrun attempt fails during the charge, the charger's progress ends in the space directly in front of the target where the maneuver failed. These overrun attempts do not provoke attacks of opportunity. For each target in the path of his charge, the charger incurs a cumulative -2 penalty on his overrun combat maneuver checks. This ability replaces mighty charge.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Charger""]]",Cavalier (Charger),Charger,<cavaliercavalierscharge_3,3,Thundering Hooves,"<p>At 3rd level, a charger's hoof attack deals an additional 1d6 points of damage and its critical threat range increases to 19-20. This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the critical threat range of a weapon. Whenever he performs a charge, the charger can make an additional hoof attack against his target with a -5 penalty on his attack roll. This ability replaces cavalier's charge.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Charger""]]",Cavalier (Charger),Charger,<cavaliercavalierweaponandarmorproficiency_1,1,Weapon and Armor Proficiency,"<p>A charger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields). A charger's cavalier levels stack with any fighter levels he possesses for the purpose of meeting the level prerequisite for feats that can specify a lance, such as Weapon Specialization. This replaces the cavalier's weapon and armor proficiencies.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Circuit Judge""]]",Cavalier (Circuit Judge),Circuit Judge,<cavaliertactician_1,1,Circuit,"<p>At 1st level, a circuit judge chooses a single community. While in that community or within 25 miles of it, she adds half her cavalier level (minimum 1) on Intimidate, Knowledge (local), and Sense Motive skill checks (as well as any other law-related skill checks, at the GM's discretion). Whenever she advances in level, the range within which she gains this bonus expands by another 25 miles-50 miles at 2nd level, 75 miles at 3rd level, and so forth. This bonus on Intimidate checks increases by 2 when she enters a community within this area that she hasn't visited for 1 week or more.</p><p>At 9th level and 17th level, the circuit judge can select another community within the range in which she gains this ability's bonus. She can measure from that community (as well as previous communities) to determine whether she gains this ability's bonus on the relevant skill checks.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Circuit Judge""]]",Cavalier (Circuit Judge),Circuit Judge,<cavalierdemandingchallenge_12,12,Double Jeopardy,"<p>At 12th level, whenever a circuit judge sentences a foe, she can gain the benefits of two inquisitor judgments against the foe instead of one. Using this ability does not expend a daily use of sentence.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Circuit Judge""]]",Cavalier (Circuit Judge),Circuit Judge,<cavalierchallenge_1,1,Sentence (1/day),"<p>Once per day as a swift action, the circuit judge can choose one target within sight to sentence. The circuit judge gains the potential for a variety of bonuses related to that target. The circuit judge chooses the form of these benefits from the following list of inquisitor judgments: destruction, justice, protection, purity, or smiting.</p><p>The benefits of these judgments apply only to the circuit judge and the target-the protection judgment's bonus to Armor Class, for example, applies only to attacks made by the sentenced target (not any creature who attacks the circuit judge while the judgment is active). Treat the circuit judge's level as her inquisitor level for the purposes of determining how these judgments increase in power. The circuit judge can use this ability twice per day at 1st level, plus two additional times per day for every 3 cavalier levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of 14 times per day at 19th level. She can switch her sentence as a swift action, but doing so expends an additional daily use of this ability.</p><p>Sentencing a foe requires much of the circuit judge's concentration. The circuit judge takes a -2 penalty to her Armor Class, except against attacks made by the target of her sentence.</p><p>The sentence remains in effect either until the target is dead or unconscious or until the combat ends. Sentences are considered challenges for the purposes of the effects listed in the challenge section describing the cavalier's order.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Constable""]]",Cavalier (Constable),Constable,<cavaliermount_1,1,Apprehend,"<p>A constable gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat and can attempt a grapple combat maneuver check in place of the attack at the end of a charge. At 2nd level, the constable receives a +1 bonus on Perception checks and combat maneuver checks to disarm, grapple, or trip opponents. At 7th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this bonus improves by 1. At 4th level, the constable does not treat crowds as difficult terrain.

,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Constable""]]",Cavalier (Constable),Constable,<idvalierbanner_5,5,Badge,"<p>At 5th level, a constable's badge becomes a powerful symbol of rules and authority. As long as he wears his badge, allies within 30 feet who can see him gain a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm, compulsion, and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against targets the constable has challenged. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the bonuses increase by 1. This ability replaces banner.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp
,Cavalier,"[[""Cavalier""],[""Constable""]]",Cavalier (Constable),Constable,<cavaliergreaterbanner_14,14,Greater Badge,"<p>At 14th level, a constable can hold his badge aloft as a standard action to inspire his allies to be steadfast. All allies within 30 feet gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the constable's cavalier level for 10 minutes. A given ally can benefit from this ability only once per day.

That ally can instantly take a single move or standard action to comply with the order. Taking the action dazes the ally for 1 round afterward. At 20th level, the constable can use this ability as a move action, but no more than once per round.

The ability must be triggered within 1 hour of the plan being made, and the benefits last for 1 minute per cavalier level he has. The constable can have only one plan at a time, and if a new plan is made, any old plan is lost. This ability replaces cavalier's charge.</p>",icons/tools/smithing/horseshoe-steel-blue.webp

She does not gain the benefits of her challenge (including any additional benefits granted by her order) when making a grand boast. If she successfully defeats the target of her challenge within 1 minute, however, she is vindicated in her boast and gains the benefits of her challenge against all allies of the defeated enemy who witnessed her grand boast and who are of the same or lower CR as the defeated enemy.

In a social setting, the courtly knight can attempt Diplomacy checks to make a request of a creature whose attitude toward her is unfriendly, provided that creature does not intend to harm or oppose the courtly knight or her allies in the immediate future. Further, whenever she attempts a Diplomacy check to make a request, a courtly knight can first attempt an Intimidate check (DC = 20 + the creature's Charisma modifier).

All cohorts that the daring general gains from this ability must have levels only in classes that grant a full base attack bonus (such as barbarian, fighter, paladin, or ranger), and must be at least 4 levels lower than the daring general himself. However, at 12th level and 18th level, the daring general gains an additional cohort (up to a maximum of three cohorts at 18th level) and a number of additional followers equal to the number of followers he gained from the Leadership feat (up to a maximum of triple his normal number of followers at 18th level). When determining the kinds of cohorts the daring general can attract, he treats his Leadership score as 3 lower for each subsequent cohort (effectively taking a -3 penalty for the second cohort and a -6 penalty for the third cohort).</p><p>Additionally, the daring general can grant special roles to his cohorts, as outlined below.

If she does, the mount's speed increases by 10 feet and its Dexterity score increases by 2. These benefits last for 1 hour.</p><p><i>Squire: </i>The squire's main task is to care for the daring general's arms and armor. If the squire aids the daring general in donning his armor, it takes half as much time to don as it would if someone else aided the daring general. Additionally, when the squire is adjacent to the daring general, as a standard action, she can grant a +2 bonus to the daring general's AC against the first attack made against the daring general before the squire's next turn. This counts as an application of the aid another action, but the squire does not need to threaten the attacker in question.</p><p><i>Standard Bearer: </i>The daring general's standard bearer can carry his banner in his stead, granting the benefits of his banner ability (and later, his greater banner ability) to all allies within 60 feet of the standard bearer. If the standard bearer becomes unconscious or dead, she ceases to grant these benefits.</p><p>Beyond the rules noted above, if the daring general uses his followers to create an army using the mass combat rules, that army starts with one extra tactic of the daring general's choice and a +2 bonus to its morale score.</p><p>The daring general can assign each of his followers individually to serve as either footmen or honor guards (described below). He does not need to assign either role to a given follower, if he prefers.

Followers with a particular role must group together with other followers with the same role to form an army in mass combat.</p><p><i>Footman: </i>Each follower gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls, but takes a -2 penalty to her AC and on saving throws. A footman unit gains a +2 bonus to its OM and takes a -2 penalty to its DV in mass combat.</p><p><i>Honor Guard: </i>The follower gains a +2 bonus to her AC and on saving throws, but takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
