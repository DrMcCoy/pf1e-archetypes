If an effect requires a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + twice the number of sneak attack dice expended + the petal ninja's Charisma modifier. The petal ninja can choose to create a lesser effect even if she expends more dice than required. For example, she can expend 4 sneak attack dice, but impart the effect of 3 sneak attack dice. The shower does not affect the petal ninja herself, apart from the concealment granted by using 1 sneak attack die.</p><p>1 Sneak Attack Die: Creatures within the radius gain concealment (20% miss chance).</p><p>2 Sneak Attack Dice: As 1 sneak attack die, except each creature in the radius must succeed at a Will save or be dazzled for 1d6 rounds.</p><p>3 Sneak Attack Dice: As 2 sneak attack dice, except creatures are sickened on a failed save.</p><p>4 Sneak Attack Dice: As 2 sneak attack dice, except creatures are fascinated on a failed save.</p><p>5 Sneak Attack Dice: As 2 sneak attack dice, except creatures are staggered on a failed save.</p><p>6 Sneak Attack Dice: As 2 sneak attack dice, except creatures are nauseated on a failed save.</p>",icons/weapons/thrown/dagger-ringed-grey.webp
