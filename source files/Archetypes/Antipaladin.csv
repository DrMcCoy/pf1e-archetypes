As a swift action, the blighted myrmidon chooses one target within sight to smite. Regardless of its alignment, if the target is an animal, plant, or vermin, the blighted myrmidon adds her Charisma bonus (if any) on her attack rolls and adds her blighted myrmidon level on damage rolls against the target of her smite. If the target of smite nature is an elemental, a fey, or a creature with levels of druid, hunter, ranger, or shifter, the bonus on damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per class level the blighted myrmidon has. This ability otherwise functions as smite good.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/affliction_18.jpg
