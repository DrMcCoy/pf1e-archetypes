The life channeler gains one wicker talisman corresponding to each level of druid spells she can cast, starting with 1st-level spells. These talismans are initially empty, but can hold life energy. When the life channeler ritualistically kills a creature with a coup de grace, she can store life energy in a talisman instead of gaining the plant growth effect. The creature must be of a CR equal to at least twice the spell level of the corresponding talisman. For instance, a CR 8 creature's life energy could provide energy for a talisman holding up to a 4th-level spell. A talisman is either full or empty; it can't hold more than one creature's life energy. A life channeler can expend the energy stored in a talisman to cast her domain spell of the talisman's level without expending a spell slot.</p><p>Starting at 6th level, a life channeler gathers a flock of willing sacrifices. This grants her the benefits of the Leadership feat, except that using a follower as a human sacrifice with this ability doesn't cause the life channeler to take a penalty to her Leadership score.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/spells/leaf-orange-3.jpg
