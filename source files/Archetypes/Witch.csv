,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Gravewalker""]]",Witch (Gravewalker),Gravewalker,<id-00004,1,Aura of Desecration,"<p>At first level, a gravewalker can create a 20-foot-radius aura of evil power. This aura increases the DC of channeled negative energy by +1 and the turn resistance of undead by +1. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the radius of the aura increases by 5 feet, to a maximum of 70 feet at 20th level. This ability replaces the witch's 1st-level hex.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Bonded Witch""]]",Witch (Bonded Witch),Bonded Witch,<id-00005,1,Bonded Item,"<p>At 1st level, a bonded witch gains a bonded item instead of a familiar. This bonded item is similar to a wizard's arcane bond bonded item, and follows all the rules of such an item with the following exceptions.</p><p>A bonded witch's bonded item serves as a vessel for her spells and a conduit for communication with her patron. A bonded witch must commune with her bonded item each day to prepare her spells. The bonded item stores all of the spells that the bonded witch knows, and the bonded witch cannot prepare spells that are not stored within it. A bonded witch starts with the same number of spells and gains new spells the same way as a witch, and can even add spells by learning them from scrolls in the same way, but a bonded witch cannot learn spells from another bonded item.</p><p>Since a bonded witch does not have a spellbook, starting at 2nd level, a bonded witch's bonded item can be used once per day to cast a spell dependent on the type of bonded object chosen by the bonded witch. The spell is treated like any other spell cast by the bonded witch, including its casting time, duration, and other effects dependent of the bonded witch's level. This spell cannot be further modified by metamagic feats or any other ability. As the bonded witch gains levels, the bonded item gains new spells that the bonded witch can cast in this way. She can cast any one of these spells once per day using her bonded object, but gains greater flexibility in what spells she can cast, and gains more powerful spells as she gains new levels. The bonded item spells associated with each item type are as follows.</p><p>Amulet: 2nd-stone fist; 4th-bear's endurance; 6th-burst of speed; 8th-mnemonic enhancer; 10th-stoneskin; 12th-monstrous physique IV; 14th-firebrand; 16th-iron body; 18th-overwhelming presence.</p><p>Ring: 2nd-shield; 4th-ablative barrier; 6th-protection from energy; 8th-nondetection; 10th-life bubble; 12th-resinous skin; 14th-antimagic field; 16th-deflection; 18th-spell immunity.</p><p>Staff: 2nd-shillelagh; 4th-warp wood; 6th-plant growth; 8th-arboreal hammer; 10th-passwall; 12th-move earth; 14th-changestaff; 16th-control plants; 18th-wooden phalanx.</p><p>Wand: 2nd-magic missile; 4th-knock; 6th-fireball; 8th-restoration; 10th-maximized scorching ray; 12th-bull's strength (mass); 14th-greater restoration; 16th-empowered and maximized fireball; 18th-empowered and maximized fire shield.</p><p>Weapon: 2nd-warding weapon; 4th-versatile weapon; 6th-greater magic weapon; 8th-telekinetic charge; 10th-energy siege shot; 12th-blade barrier; 14th-arcane cannon; 16th-earthquake; 18th-ride the lightning.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Gravewalker""]]",Witch (Gravewalker),Gravewalker,<id-00009,1,Bonethrall,"<p>At first level, a gravewalker can take control of an undead creature within her aura of desecration by forcing her will upon it (Will negates, using her hex DC). If it fails the save, the creature falls under her control as if she had used command undead (once control is established, the undead remain controlled even if outside the witch's aura). Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each day to resist her command. The witch can control up to 1 HD of undead creatures per caster level. If an undead creature is under the control of another creature, the witch must make an opposed Charisma check whenever her orders conflict with that creature's. This replaces the witch's hex gained at 4th level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Bouda""]]",Witch (Bouda),Bouda,<id-00004,1,Bouda's Eye,"<p>A bouda's gaze can bestow ill fortune on her enemies. This hex can affect a creature within 30 feet that the bouda can see. The target takes a -2 penalty on one of the following (bouda's choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. The hex lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the bouda's Intelligence modifier. A successful Will saving throw reduces the duration of the hex to 1 round. Once per day when the bouda uses this hex, she can impose two different penalties on the target instead of just one. If the bouda takes the evil eye hex, it increases the number of different penalties she can impose on the hex's target by 1. At 8th level, the penalties imposed by this hex increase to -4. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Flood Walker""]]",Witch (Flood Walker),Flood Walker,<id-00012,10,Breath Siphon,"<p>At 10th level, a flood walker gains strength from his patron when creatures suffocate or drown. Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher asphyxiates or drowns within 30 feet of him, the flood walker gains the benefit of a death knell spell for 1 hour. If a flood walker drowns such a victim himself (such as by holding a grappled or helpless creature under water until it dies or by killing it with a suffocation spell), the duration is doubled, and the flood walker gains 4d8 temporary hit points and a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength instead of the usual temporary hit points and enhancement bonus to Strength from death knell. Like death knell itself, this is an evil act.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Gingerbread Witch""]]",Witch (Gingerbread Witch),Gingerbread Witch,<id-00004,1,Cauldron Cook,"<p>A gingerbread witch gains the cauldron and child-scentUM hexes at 1st level. When brewing potions with her cauldron, she can create small candies, pastries, or similar edible items identical in effect and application to normal potions. At 10th level, she gains the cook peopleUM hex.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Hex Channeler""]]",Witch (Hex Channeler),Hex Channeler,<id-00008,2,Channel Energy,"<p>At 2nd level, a hex channeler can call upon her patron to release a wave of energy from herself or her familiar. A good witch channels positive energy (like a good cleric), and an evil witch channels negative energy (like an evil cleric). A witch who is neither good nor evil must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy; once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed.</p><p>Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the witch. The witch can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). This otherwise functions as a cleric using channel energy, except the witch does not require a holy symbol to use this ability. The hex channeler uses her witch level as her cleric level for all other effects dependent upon channel energy (except increasing the amount of damage healed or dealt). The hex channeler can choose whether or not to include herself or her familiar in this effect.</p><p>This burst heals or deals 1d6 points of damage. Every time the hex channeler is able to learn a new hex (including major or grand hexes, but not hexes gained through the Extra Hex feat), she can instead increase her channel energy amount by 1d6. This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Winter Witch""]]",Witch (Winter Witch),Winter Witch,<id-00019,1,Cold Flesh,"<p>At 1st level, a winter witch gains endure elements as a constant spell-like ability, but only against cold temperatures. At 4th level, she gains cold resistance 5, making her comfortable in near-freezing temperatures. At 9th-level, this increases to cold resistance 10, and at 14th level, it becomes immunity to cold. This replaces the witch's 4th-level hex.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Dimensional Occultist""]]",Witch (Dimensional Occultist),Dimensional Occultist,<id-00011,8,Commune with Familiar,"<p>At 8th level, a dimensional occultist can use her familiar as a link between herself and strange, otherworldly intelligences on other planes. Once per week, she may use this link to cast contact other plane as a spell-like ability, at a caster level equal to her witch level. The entity contacted replies to the witch via her familiar (which speaks in a strange disembodied voice), via telepathic contact, or by some similarly disconcerting method of communication. When a witch uses this method to contact other planes, she gains a +4 bonus on the Intelligence check to avoid the decrease to Intelligence and Charisma. If she still fails the save, the Intelligence/Charisma decrease lasts only 24 hours rather than a number of weeks. This ability replaces the witch's hex gained at 8th level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Ley Line Guardian""]]",Witch (Ley Line Guardian),Ley Line Guardian,<id-00004,1,Conduit Surge,"<p>At 1st level, a ley line guardian is adept at channeling energy from ley lines to enhance her own spells. As a swift action, she can increase her effective caster level for the next spell she casts in that round by 1d4-1 levels. After performing a conduit surge, the ley line guardian must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + level of spell cast + number of additional caster levels granted) or become staggered for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell cast. At 8th level, the caster level increase becomes 1d4. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modif ier.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Gingerbread Witch""]]",Witch (Gingerbread Witch),Gingerbread Witch,<id-00011,8,Confection Conjuring,"<p>At 8th level, a gingerbread witch can use shadow conjuration as a spell-like ability. Items and creatures she conjures appear to be made of fanciful foodstuffs, and because of this, sentient creatures gain a +2 bonus on Will saves to disbelieve the illusion. However, they otherwise function as described for the shadow conjuration spell. For every 3 witch levels beyond 8th, the gingerbread witch can duplicate conjuration (creation) and conjuration (summoning) spells of 1 level higher, up to a maximum of 7th-level spell effects at 20th level (though they are still only 20% real). The witch can use this ability once per day for every 4 witch levels she has.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Coral Witch""]]",Witch (Coral Witch),Coral Witch,<id-00019,1,Coral Familiar,"<p>A coral witch crafts her familiar out of living coral, coaxing the tiny organisms to grow in the shape of a larger animal or vermin. The coral witch chooses a familiar as normal, but its type changes to vermin (aquatic) and it gains the amphibious special quality. The coral witch's familiar has an Intelligence score as normal for the witch's level, but it has immunity to mind-affecting effects. When underwater near a coral reef of any size, a coral witch can spend 8 hours to restore her familiar to full health at no cost, unless the familiar is killed, in which case she must follow the usual rules for replacing her familiar. A coral witch can never gain an improved familiar.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Witch-Watcher""]]",Witch (Witch-Watcher),Witch-Watcher,<id-00018,1,Covenant Ally,"<p>Once per day when preparing her spells, a witch-watcher makes a covenant with her patron to provide protection to a single creature, known as her covenant ally. As a standard action when her covenant ally is within 30 feet, a witch-watcher can grant it one of the abilities listed below. Unless otherwise noted, each ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to the witch-watcher's Intelligence modifier. She can grant a number of abilities per day equal to 1/2 her witch level (minimum 1).</p><p>Health: The covenant ally gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the witch-watcher's witch level + her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). The temporary hit points from this ability do not stack with themselves, but additional uses cause the total number of temporary hit points and the duration to reset.</p><p>Safeguard: The covenant ally gains a deflection bonus to AC or a resistance bonus on saving throws equal to 1/2 the witch-watcher's witch level (minimum 1). When given, this bonus can be divided between the AC and saving throws as the witch-watcher wishes, up to a maximum of +5 for either.</p><p>Solace: The witch-watcher temporarily disrupts a spell affecting her covenant ally by succeeding at a dispel check against the spell, as per dispel magic. The ability suppresses a spell effect for a number of rounds equal to the witchwatcher's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). If the spell affects multiple creatures, this ability suppresses the spell effect only for the covenant ally. At the end of this duration, the spell resumes and the suppressed rounds do not count against its total duration. This ability has no effect on spells that are instantaneous or have a duration of permanent.</p><p>Spell Resistance: The covenant ally gains spell resistance equal to 6 + the witch-watcher's witch level for a number of rounds equal to the witch-watcher's Intelligence modifier. At 10th level, the spell resistance increases to 11 + the witch-watcher's witch level. The spell resistance cannot be suppressed, but it doesn't affect spells cast by the witch-watcher.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Alley Witch""]]",Witch (Alley Witch),Alley Witch,<id-00019,1,Crowd Patron,"<p>An alley witch draws power not from a patron, but from the crowd of minds around her. She doesn't select a patron at 1st level; instead, she gains the following bonus spells at the listed levels.</p><p>2nd-ears of the city (see page 30), 4th-alter self, 6th-witnessUM, 8th-shadow stepUM, 10th-mage's private sanctum, 12th-heroes' feast, 14th-limited wish, 16th-create demiplaneUM, 18th-shades.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Demon-Sworn""]]",Witch (Demon-Sworn),Demon-Sworn,<id-00020,1,Cruel Hex,"<p>A demon-sworn always inflicts some pain, whether she wants to or not. Each hex deals 1d4 points of nonlethal damage to creatures affected by it, in addition to any damage the hex normally deals.</p><p>For major hexes, the damage increases to 2d4. For grand hexes, the damage increases to 4d4. Each die result of a natural 4 deals 1 point of lethal damage to the demon-sworn.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Hag of Gyronna""]]",Witch (Hag of Gyronna),Hag of Gyronna,<id-00008,2,Curdle Thoughts,"<p>At 2nd level, a hag of Gyronna can insert negative emotions into the mind of a single target. She gains a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Bluff checks to sow suspicion, hatred, or other forms of animosity. In addition, a hag of Gyronna can choose to increase the save DC of any spell with the fear descriptor she casts by 2. She can increase a spell's DC in this way a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her witch level. This ability replaces the witch's 2nd-level hex.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Tatterdemalion""]]",Witch (Tatterdemalion),Tatterdemalion,<id-00019,1,Dancing Strings,"<p>A tatterdemalion adds animate rope to her class spell list and spells her familiar knows.

,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Rhetorician""]]",Witch (Rhetorician),Rhetorician,<id-00004,1,Debater,"<p>A rhetorician is an expert at making counterarguments and treating everything as a debate. When an opponent attempts a Diplomacy check to change another target's attitude or request aid, the rhetorician can attempt to make a counterargument to negate the opponent's efforts. The rhetorician attempts a Diplomacy check as an immediate action, with a DC equal to the result of the opponent's Diplomacy check. The target of the opponent's Diplomacy check must be able to see and hear the rhetorician. If the rhetorician's Diplomacy check is successful, the opponent's Diplomacy check fails.

,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Ashiftah""]]",Witch (Ashiftah),Ashiftah,<id-00019,3,Deliver Touch Spells,"<p>Starting at 3rd level, an ashiftah can use her veil to deliver touch spells. After casting a touch spell, as a full-round action, she can tear a strip from her veil and whisper to it, designating a target. She then releases the scrap of fabric, which drifts on the wind to the target and delivers the spell as a ranged touch attack. The target must be within 20 feet of the witch. The veil mends itself after the spell is delivered.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Demon-Sworn""]]",Witch (Demon-Sworn),Demon-Sworn,<id-00019,1,Demonic Pact,"<p>A demon-sworn makes a pact with a demonic entity, forever binding her to the forces of the Abyss and corrupting her connection with her patron. At the indicated levels, she gains the spells below in place of her normal patron spells: 2nd-protection from good, 6th-unholy blight, 10th-dispel good, 14th-blasphemy, 18th-unholy aura. Casting spells with the evil descriptor from this replacement list has no effect on the demonsworn's alignment.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Dimensional Occultist""]]",Witch (Dimensional Occultist),Dimensional Occultist,<id-00008,2,Dimensional Augmentation,"<p>At 2nd level, a dimensional occultist can augment her spells by incorporating complex mathematical equations and formulae into the casting, typically by inscribing these equations with chalk or charcoal onto a solid surface (although scribing them on paper or into wet sand works fine as well). Augmenting a spell in this way adds both a somatic component (the actual scribing of the equations) and a material component (the writing stylus and ink, chalk, charcoal, or other medium) to the spell, and increases its casting time to a number of rounds equal to the spell's level (if the spell's casting time is already 1 minute or more, the casting time is not altered). As a result, using dimensional augmentation to cast a spell isn't a good option in the heat of combat. Augmenting a spell in this manner increases its effective caster level by +1. A dimensional occultist can augment her spells in this manner once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day for every even-numbered witch level she gains. This ability replaces the witch's hex gained at 2nd level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Dimensional Occultist""]]",Witch (Dimensional Occultist),Dimensional Occultist,<id-00013,12,Dimensional Waypoints,"<p>At 12th level, a dimensional occultist can create a dimensional waypoint by spending 2d4 minutes inscribing a number of equations on a solid surface (such as a wall, tree, stone floor, or structure) with a writing instrument. The exact configuration of these equations is unique to each witch. From that point on, when she uses dimensional travel to travel to that location, she does so without any chance of mishap. Teleport always sends the witch to this spot, and even plane shift, if used to travel to that site, is precisely accurate. Once a dimensional waypoint is set, it remains active for that witch despite the condition of the inscription or even that of the surface upon which it was inscribed-it is the act of inscribing the waypoint, not the waypoint itself, that matters. At 12th level, and then again every two witch levels thereafter, the dimensional occultist can maintain an additional waypoint. She can replace a waypoint she's already set by simply using that waypoint's unique equation at a new site. This ability replaces the witch's hex gained at 12th level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Witch-Watcher""]]",Witch (Witch-Watcher),Witch-Watcher,<id-00019,1,Diminished Spellcasting,"<p>A witch-watcher gains one fewer spell of each level than normal.

,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Putrefactor""]]",Witch (Putrefactor),Putrefactor,<id-00004,1,Disgorge Familiar,"<p>As a standard action, a putrefactor can cough up her familiar, allowing it to act as a separate entity. She can also devour it again as a standard action when the familiar is within reach. While within her, the familiar cannot be targeted for effects or take any action, but effects affecting it persist, and their duration continues until the next time she disgorges it.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg
,Witch,"[[""Witch""],[""Putrefactor""]]",Witch (Putrefactor),Putrefactor,<id-00010,6,Disgorge Swarm,"<p>At 6th level, while her familiar is inside her, the putrefactor can disgorge all the crawling creatures within her at once as a standard action, retaining only her familiar. When she does, she loses 2 hit points per class level and forms a spider swarm as per the spell vomit swarm. The swarm gains the Armor Class and saving throw bonuses of her familiar. The swarm deals her verminous blood damage instead of its normal damage; while the swarm lasts, the putrefactor loses access to her verminous blood ability. The witch can target creatures with her hexes as if she occupied both the swarm's space and her own. When the duration ends, the swarm tries its best to return to her and crawl back into her body, restoring hit points equal to its current hit points, up to her maximum hit points. If the swarm dies or cannot return to her once the spell's duration ends, the witch does not regain any of her spent hit points. Once she reabsorbs the swarm, she can't disgorge it again for 1 hour.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_10.jpg

If the target succeeds at the saving throw against the spell, it does not wake up, nor does it have any recollection of having resisted a spell. If appropriate, the dreamweaver may incorporate elements of a mind-affecting spell (i.e., sow thought, suggestion, and so on) into the target's subconscious so it believes the spell's effects originated in its dreams (the details of how these elements fit into the dream is up to the GM).

She can reshape one of the target's memories as if using modify memory. Alternatively, she may insert herself into the dreaming memories of the target, prompting the target's mind to show her some specific information; the dreamer's subconscious may resist, or try to deceive her with out-of-context memories, similar to the way a corpse can resist when questioned with speak with dead.

For a diseased target, the witch must tend to the sick person for an hour; he makes his next saving throw against the disease as normal, but the witch suffers the effects of the failed save instead of the diseased creature. The witch does not actually become poisoned or diseased (and is not contagious and does not need to be cured), but suffers the effects of the affliction as if she had been.

The target can end the effect with a successful Strength check (DC = 15 + 1/2 the tatterdemalion's witch level) as a standard action, or by slashing the stitches with a magic slashing weapon as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Either way, the victim takes 1d4 points of bleed damage and either is dazzled (for stitched eyes) or takes a -2 penalty on bite attack and damage rolls and a 20% chance of spell failure with verbal components (for a stitched mouth). Either residual effect lasts 1 minute per witch level.

In addition, whenever the hair strikes a foe, the witch can attempt to grapple that foe with her hair as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity, using her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength modifier when making the combat maneuver check.

A spell that doesn't normally have a verbal component gains one when cast using this ability. A wish doesn't need to mention the name of a specific spell, but it must describe an outcome that can be accomplished by casting a spell the vellemancer knows (for example, wishing to be more likable could supply the verbal component for alter self, eagle's splendor, or even baleful polymorph, depending on the results). A vellemancer gains a +1 bonus to her caster level when using a creature's wish as a verbal component in this manner, but she cannot include herself as a target of such spells. She can be affected by such a spell if it affects an area rather than one or more targets. A vellemancer is under no compulsion to grant a creature's wish.

Only nonmagical objects that are not alchemical items, weapons, armor, or useful tools can be part of a wyrmwitch's hoard. If the hoard falls below this value, the wyrmwitch cannot sleep on his hoard (see below) or add new spells to it until its value is restored.</p><p>A wyrmwitch's spells come from this link with his hoard, and its ability to hold spells functions in a manner identical to the way a witch's spells are normally granted by a familiar.

A witch's familiar and a wyrmwitch's hoard can exchange spells in the same way two normal witch familiars do. Also, a witch can add a spell to his hoard from a wizard's spellbook, if the spellbook is kept in the hoard and the spell is on the witch's class spell list. The wyrmwitch must sleep on the spellbook in his hoard for a number of days equal to the spell's level, after which he must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + spell level) to learn the spell.

If the wyrmwitch does prepare spells after properly sleeping on his hoard, he gains the ability to call on his hoard to cast any one spell it is holding and that he is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared.
