,Gunslinger,"[[""Gunslinger""],[""Gun Scavenger""]]",Gunslinger (Gun Scavenger),Gun Scavenger,<id-00010,2,Arbitrary Aim,"<p>Starting at 2nd level, a gun scavenger's attacks with firearms are difficult to predict. When shooting a firearm at a creature that has a dodge or insight bonus to its Armor Class, the gun scavenger treats the combined bonus as if it were 1 lower. This value increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of 5 at 20th level). This ability replaces nimble.</p>",icons/weapons/guns/gun-red.webp
,Gunslinger,"[[""Gunslinger""],[""Gun Tank""]]",Gunslinger (Gun Tank),Gun Tank,<id-00015,4,Armor Training,"<p>At 4th level, a gun tank learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever she is wearing armor, the armor check penalty is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by her armor increases by 1. Every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and 16th), the bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of a -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase to the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed. This ability stacks with the fighter class ability of the same name. If the gun tank has both class features, she takes the most advantageous benefit of the two class features. This ability replaces the bonus feats the gunslinger gains at 4th level and every four levels thereafter.</p>",icons/weapons/guns/gun-red.webp
,Gunslinger,"[[""Gunslinger""],[""Gulch Gunner""]]",Gunslinger (Gulch Gunner),Gulch Gunner,<id-00022,9,Belly Shot,"<p>At 9th level, a gulch gunner can press her firearm directly against a vulnerable location of an adjacent target, dealing additional damage. When the gulch gunner successfully hits an adjacent target with a ranged firearm attack, she deals +1d6 points of damage. This damage increases to +2d6 at 13th level and to +3d6 at 17th level. Creatures immune to precision damage, critical hits, or sneak attacks do not take this additional damage. This ability replaces the gun training ability gained at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>",icons/weapons/guns/gun-red.webp
,Gunslinger,"[[""Gunslinger""],[""Firebrand""]]",Gunslinger (Firebrand),Firebrand,<id-00021,5,Bombs,"<p>At 5th level, the firebrand gains the bombs ability as an alchemist of her gunslinger level - 4, using her Charisma modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier to determine her number of bombs per day and the DC to avoid splash damage. The firebrand adds her Charisma modifier to her bombs' damage instead of her Intelligence modifier, even if she has the throw anything class feature. In addition, the firebrand's bombs are always under the effect of the explosive bombs discovery.

Except for the requirement that she must use a firearm and must have at least 1 grit point to use it, this deed otherwise works identically to a rogue's sneak attack class feature (including the requirement that she must be within 30 feet of her target to deal this extra damage), and stacks with the sneak shot ability (see below) and sneak attack. This deed replaces the utility shot deed.</p><p>Long Range Shifty Shot (Ex): At 7th level, a bushwhacker can double the range at which she deals extra damage from a sneak attack or shifty shot (from 30 feet to 60 feet) with a firearm by spending 1 grit point. When she spends this grit point, she must still have at least 1 grit point left to deal extra damage from shifty shot if she is using this deed.

She gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Dexterity modifier with that crossbow. Furthermore, when she scores a critical hit with that type of crossbow, her critical modifier increases by 1 (a 2 becomes a 3, for example).</p><p>Every 4 levels thereafter, she can pick a different type of crossbow, gaining the bonus damage and increased critical multiplier with that type of crossbow as well.

,Gunslinger,"[[""Gunslinger""],[""Bolt Ace""]]",Gunslinger (Bolt Ace),Bolt Ace,<id-00004,1,Deeds,"<p>A bolt ace can perform the following deeds with a crossbow instead of a firearm: gunslinger initiative, pistol-whip, dead shot, targeting, bleeding wound, death's shot, and stunning shot. The bolt ace swaps the following deeds.</p><p>Sharp Shoot (Ex): At 1st level, a bolt ace can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing a crossbow at a target within its first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the amount of grit points a deed costs (such as Signature Deed). This deed replaces deadeye.</p><p>Vigilant Loading (Ex): At 1st level, as long as a bolt ace has at least 1 grit point, she does not provoke attacks of opportunity when loading a crossbow. This deed replaces quick clear.</p><p>Shooter's Resolve (Ex): At 3rd level, a bolt ace can spend 1 grit point when making a crossbow attack as a standard action and ignore the effects of concealment (though not total concealment) and cover (other than total cover) against that shot. This deed replaces utility shot.</p><p>Distracting Shot (Ex): At 7th level, a bolt ace can spend 1 grit point and choose to miss a target that she could normally attack within her range with a crossbow attack. When she does, the target loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for 1 round. This deed replaces startling shot.</p><p>Vigilant Shooter (Ex): At 11th level, as long as a bolt ace spends 1 grit point when she does so, she does not provoke attacks of opportunity when firing a crossbow. This deed replaces expert loading.</p><p>Inexplicable Reload (Ex): At 11th level, loading a crossbow becomes unthinking and automatic for a bolt ace. As long as she has at least 1 grit point, she always starts each round of combat (even a surprise round) with her crossbow loaded. Also the amount of time needed to reload a crossbow decreases by one step: a standard action becomes a move action, a move action becomes a swift action, a swift action becomes a free action, and a free action becomes not an action. This deed replaces lightning reload.</p><p>Pinning Shot (Ex): At 15th level, the bolt ace can spend 1 grit point while shooting a crossbow and attempt to pin down its target with the bolt. If the crossbow attack hits, it pins the target to a nearby object, to a wall, or to the ground, entangling and staggering the target. While pinned by the bolt, the target cannot move out of its space until it takes a standard action to free itself from the pinning bolt, except by means of teleportation.

Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p><p>A planar rifter gains the following deeds.</p><p>Infused Bullet (Su): At 1st level, a planar rifter's bullets carry the essence of a plane to which his grit pool is attuned, striking true against creatures that shrink from that plane's nature. As long as he has at least 1 point in his grit pool, he gains the following benefits: if he infuses his bullets with an alignment, his bullet's damage counts as that alignment for the purposes of overcoming DR; if he infuses his bullets with an element, half of his bullet's damage changes to an energy type determined by the element infused: acid (earth), cold (water), electricity (air), or fire (fire).</p><p>Planar Surge (Su): At 7th level, a planar rifter can spend 1 grit point as a swift action to change the attunement of his grit pool to any alignment or element. This new attunement remains for 1 minute, after which time the grit pool becomes unattuned.</p><p>Breaching Shot (Su): At 15th level, a planar rifter can fire bullets with such precision that he tears temporary rifts between planes. As a standard action, he can spend 3 grit points to shoot at a location within his firearm's first range increment and tear a 10-foot-radius portal to a plane of his choice. The rift leads to a random location on the plane that is between 5 and 500 miles from his intended destination, as plane shift. The rift remains open for 1 minute, during which time any number of willing creatures can pass through. It is a one-way rift, and it is insufficiently stable to reveal details about the environment on the other side.</p><p>Banishing Shot (Su): At 19th level, whenever a planar rifter confirms a critical hit against an extraplanar target, he can spend 1 grit to deal normal damage, and the target must succeed at a Will saving throw with a DC equal to 20 + the planar rifter's Wisdom modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target is returned to its original plane as per the banishment spell.</p>",icons/weapons/guns/gun-red.webp

If she misses with the attack, she grazes the target, dealing half the extra damage anyway. This is precision damage and is not multiplied if the attack is a critical hit. This precision damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, to 3d6 at 10th level, to 4d6 at 15th level, and to 5d6 at 20th level. This precision damage stacks with sneak attack and other forms of precision damage. The cost of using this deed cannot be reduced with the Signature Deed feat, the true grit class feature, or any similar effect. This deed replaces the deadeye deed.</p><p>Deadeye (Ex): At 7th level, the pistolero gains the deadeye deed, which is normally a 1st-level gunslinger deed. This deed replaces the startling shot deed.</p><p>Twin Shot Knockdown (Ex): At 11th level, when the pistolero hits a single target with two or more one-handed firearm attacks during her turn, she can spend 1 grit point to knock the target prone.

This deed replaces the gunslinger's startling shot deed.</p><p>Skeleton Crew: At 11th level, as long as a wyrm sniper has at least 1 grit point, she treats all light siege engines as requiring a crew of one fewer than normal to operate (minimum 1).

If the wyrm sniper hits her target, the creature falls to the ground, regardless of its altitude, taking the appropriate amount of falling damage as a result. As long as the target has at least one functioning wing, it may attempt a DC 20 Fly check to gain the benefits of feather fall instead of plummeting to the ground.

The line's length is twice the length of the weapon's cone (30 feet for most early firearms).</p><p>Shaped Blast: Select one additional square adjacent to the scattering shot's area of effect; creatures in this square are also affected by the scattering shot.</p><p>Vortex: The firearm releases an explosive torrent of air in the scattering shot's affected area for 1 round, creating a strong wind effect (25 mph) that can disperse fog and smoke effects such as those created by fog cloud. This replaces the utility shot deed.</p><p>Overload (Ex): At 7th level, a scatter gunner knows just how to hold his weapon to maximize its devastating scattering effects. As a full-round action, a scatter gunner can make a scattering shot to fire a concentrated payload of pellets that strains his firearm. This doubles the area affected by the scattering shot (a 30-foot cone for most early firearms), increases the firearm's misfire value by 2, and causes each successful attack to deal an additional 1d6 points of damage that is not multiplied on a critical hit.

The gunner squire must be adjacent to her liege and able to communicate to use this deed, though a knight may move away from the gunner squire during his turn and still gain the benefits of this deed. This deed replaces the gunslinger's dodge deed.</p><p>Side Arm (Ex): At 3rd level, as a full-round action, a gunner squire can spend 1 grit point to reload a one-handed or two-handed firearm she is holding. If the firearm has multiple barrels, she can reload a number of barrels per round equal to her Dexterity modifier (minimum 1). A gunner squire equipped with alchemical cartridges (see Ultimate Equipment) can use this deed to reload multiple firearms at once, dividing the number of barrels she's able to reload among the firearms she is carrying however she wishes, even if this would mean stowing and retrieving multiple firearms from her equipment with one action.

,Gunslinger,"[[""Gunslinger""],[""Experimental Gunsmith""]]",Gunslinger (Experimental Gunsmith),Experimental Gunsmith,<id-00021,5,Innovations,"<p>An experimental gunsmith starts play with one innovation she can make to her experimental firearms, selected from the list below. This innovation is a radical change to the typical design of a firearm, and comes with both additional benefits and noteworthy drawbacks. The experimental gunsmith can maintain only one experimental firearm modified with one or more innovations, as it requires constant adjustments and much of her time is spent maintaining the weapon. If the experimental gunsmith takes the Gunsmithing feat, she can create other firearms using a single innovation she knows (or add one innovation to an existing firearm), though such weapons become unreliable over time. The misfire value of such weapons increases by 1 for each week after its creation, although the experimental gunsmith can return the misfire rate to normal by spending 1 day maintaining the weapon and spending 50 gp in raw materials. For the purposes of crafting such firearms, each innovation is treated as the masterwork weapon quality (with a value of 300 gp).</p><p>At 5th level, and every four levels after that (9th, 13th, and 17th level), the experimental gunsmith learns one additional innovation from the list below. These represent constant and increasingly skilled tinkering with a single firearm in her possession, and when the experimental gunsmith gains an innovation, she may immediately apply it to her experimental firearm. Once an innovation has been selected, it cannot be changed. This ability replaces gun training.</p><p>Expanded Capacity: The experimental gunsmith increases her firearm's capacity by one (generally by adding another barrel, depending on the weapon's design). She also increases its weight by 50%. Because of the complexity of increasing its capacity, her weapon is more prone to misfire, and its misfire value increases by 1 (this is in addition to any misfire increase if the weapon is made with the Gunsmithing feat).</p><p>Expanded Chamber: The experimental gunsmith's firearm has a much larger than normal chamber for black powder, allowing her to use 2 doses of powder with each shot. The weapon grants a +1 circumstance bonus on damage rolls. However, when the weapon misfires, it causes a flashburn. This is the same as the weapon exploding (dealing damage from a corner of the experimental gunsmith's square), except the weapon is not automatically destroyed. If a broken weapon misfires, it is destroyed as normal.</p><p>Grapple Launcher: The experimental gunsmith's firearm includes a special set of rails that allows her to slide a grappling hook over the barrel and fire it as a full-round action. The grappling hook anchors into anything she successfully hits with an attack roll, and the DC of the Strength check required to pull the grappling hook loose is equal to her attack roll to lodge it in place. A Disable Device check can remove it with a +5 bonus on the check, and a creature struck by the hook can escape it with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check with a +5 bonus on the check. The firearm is powerful enough to fire a hook trailing up to 100 feet of rope, but throws off the balance of the experimental gunsmith's firearm, reducing its range increment by 50%.</p><p>Recoilless: The experimental gunsmith's firearm includes a series of gears, springs, and pistons designed to reduce its recoil and thus improve accuracy. The range increment of the weapon increases by 10 feet. However, the system is fragile, and easily damaged. Anytime the weapon misfires, this system becomes broken and does not function until the experimental gunsmith spends 1 hour repairing it.</p><p>Vial Launcher: The experimental gunsmith adds a special tube onto her firearm that can hold 1 vial of alchemical material, such as alchemist's fire, a tanglefoot bag, or a thunderstone. A special trigger allows her to channel the force of black powder into this tube to launch the vial as a ranged attack with half the range increment of her firearm. The experimental gunsmith can take this action in place of any single ranged attack, and may use the same attack bonus that she can apply to the firearm. If the alchemical substance has a save DC, it becomes 10 + 1/2 her experimental gunsmith level + her Wisdom modifier when she launches the vial from her firearm. This increase only applies to the initial saving throw. If additional saving throws are called for, they are resolved as normal. Reloading the tube is a time-consuming process and requires two full-round actions. If the weapon misfires while loaded with an alchemical substance, it detonates with the experimental gunsmith (and the firearm) as the target.</p>",icons/weapons/guns/gun-red.webp
