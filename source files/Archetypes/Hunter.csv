When the courtly hunter gains this ability, she chooses a Tiny animal. When under the effects of the subtle companion ability, the courtly hunter's animal companion can change between a shrunken, more innocuous version of its original shape or the shape of the chosen animal as a standard action. When it transforms, it loses abilities dependent on its original shape and gains abilities from its new shape as beast shape II. At 13th and 19th levels, the courtly hunter can select an additional form to add to the animal companion's list of choices while it is in its polymorphed form.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/spells/wild-jade-3.jpg

A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter's effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion's statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter's tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p><p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter's animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature's ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature's ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature's ally immediately ends.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/spells/wild-jade-3.jpg

In urban settings, an urban hunter's animal companion seems domesticated and likely harmless to anyone who has not seen it in combat (potentially reducing the DC of Diplomacy checks to convince anyone to allow it into secure areas). It draws no more attention than a friendly dog, loyal horse, or similar tame animal.</p><p>Creatures who have never seen the animal companion make an attack must succeed at a Sense Motive check (opposed by the animal companion's Stealth check) to realize the animal companion is a potential threat.

This prevents sharks and other predators with keen scent from being drawn to the pelagic hunter's position by the blood and makes it harder for such creatures to track her.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/spells/wild-jade-3.jpg
,Hunter,"[[""Hunter""],[""Forester""]]",Hunter (Forester),Forester,<id-00031,2,Bonus Feat,"<p>At 2nd level, a forester gains one bonus combat feat.

The companion's type changes to magical beast (augmented animal), but this doesn't change any of its statistics and it counts as an animal, not as a magical beast, for the purposes of determining all effects, prerequisites, and so on. It does not learn tricks, but it does have an Intelligence score equal to that of a familiar belonging to a wizard of the courtly hunter's hunter level.

To use green empathy, the plant master and the plant creature must be within 30 feet of each other under normal conditions.

Once a hunter level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the packmaster's service. She must release the companion or wait until the companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion, which she can then do the next time she refreshes her spell slots for the day.

(For example, a packmaster can apply precise companion to one companion, woodland stride to another, and a given teamwork feat to a third, but cannot apply any of those to two animal companions at once.)

When using animal focus on herself or her other animal companion, the ability counts against her minutes per day as normal. She can have only two animal aspects in effect at a time-one that counts against her minutes per day and one that doesn't-and they can't both target the same companion.

A hunter may teach her companion hunter's tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p><p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives.
