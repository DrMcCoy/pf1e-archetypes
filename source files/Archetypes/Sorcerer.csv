See page 18 for information on dragon's blood. For the purposes of harvesting dragon's blood, treat the dragon drinker as though she has Dragoncrafting feat. At 5th level, drinking a vial of dragon's blood is a standard action that provides the dragon drinker with the normal benef its of the item, as well as a +1 bonus to her caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell effects on a single spell cast within 1 minute. At 7th level, a consumed vial of dragon blood also heals 1d8 points of damage instead of the standard 1d4.

This action may only be performed once per round, and can be performed a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

Additionally, when she consumes dragon's blood, it heals 3d8 points of damage and provides a +3 resistance bonus on Fortitude and Will saves for 1 minute in place of its normal effects.

The recipient of the spell tattoo must be willing to receive the spell tattoo. If she gives the spell tattoo to herself, it does not count against the regular limit of magic tattoos she can have. The spell tattoo must be of a spell that she knows that has no material or focus component. She can maintain one spell tattoo created by this ability at a time-if she uses this ability again, the previous spell tattoo she created fades away. Spell tattoos she creates with Inscribe Magic Tattoo do not count against this limit. She can use this ability twice per day at 11th level, and three times per day at 15th level.

This veil decreases the light level by one step and remains for a number of rounds equal to the sorcerer's Charisma modifier. At 7th level, the veil increases to a 30-foot radius. At 8th level, the veil decreases the light level by two steps. If the light level is decreased past darkness, the veil is treated as deeper darkness. At 14th level, the veil increases to 60 feet and grants any creature within it cover (even against senses normally able to penetrate total darkness, such as the see in darkness ability). An umbral scion can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_14.jpg

This spell must be one that lacks focus components and costly material components. She can now use that spell as a spell-like ability once per day. This spell-like ability is not enhanced by her Varisian Tattoo, but it functions at +2 caster levels above her sorcerer caster level. Whenever she gains a bloodline power at a later date, she may change this spell-like ability to another qualifying spell.

She may add an additional spell selected from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to her list of spells known. This spell must be one level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. A wishcrafter can only use these spells in conjunction with her wishbound arcana ability. For example, if she used this ability to learn cat's grace, she can only cast it when another creature wishes for it, and can't cast it on herself because it is a targeted spell. She cannot use these spells to craft or recharge magic items. These bonus spells replace the bloodline spells gained by the sorcerer's bloodline.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_14.jpg

,Sorcerer,"[[""Sorcerer""],[""Tattooed Sorcerer""]]",Sorcerer (Tattooed Sorcerer),Tattooed Sorcerer,<sorcererbloodline_1,1,Familiar Tattoo,"<p>A tattooed sorcerer gains a familiar as an arcane bond, as a wizard equal to her sorcerer level. Her sorcerer levels stack with any wizard or witch levels she possesses when determining the powers of her familiar-this ability does not allow her to have both a familiar and a bonded item.</p><p>Unlike most familiars, her familiar can transform itself into a tattoo that she carries in her flesh. Transforming into a tattoo or back to normal familiar form is a move action for her familiar. In tattoo form, the familiar looks like a stylized version of itself, but does not count as a creature separate from the tattooed sorcerer. In tattoo form it continues to grant its special familiar ability (Core Rulebook 82), but otherwise has no abilities and can take no actions except to transform from tattoo into creature. A familiar tattoo cannot be erased or dispelled. This ability replaces her 1st-level bloodline power.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_14.jpg
,Sorcerer,"[[""Sorcerer""],[""Wishcrafter""]]",Sorcerer (Wishcrafter),Wishcrafter,<id-00002,7,Heart's Desire,"<p>At 7th level, as a swift action, a wishcrafter can force a single creature within 30 feet to confess its deepest desire. The target receives a Will save to negate this effect (DC 10 + 1/2 the wishcrafter's level + the wishcrafter's Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the creature must immediately wish aloud in a clear voice for something it truly desires, allowing the wishcrafter to activate her wishbound arcana ability if she knows a spell that can fulfill that wish. This is a mind-affecting effect. Regardless of whether the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of the same wishcrafter's heart's desire ability again for 24 hours. The wishcrafter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus.

This source can represent a blood relation or an extreme event involving a creature somewhere in the family's past. For example, a sorcerer might have a dragon as a distant relative or her grandfather might have signed a terrible contract with a devil. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways as the sorcerer gains levels. A sorcerer must pick one bloodline upon taking her first level of sorcerer. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a sorcerer learns an additional spell, derived from her bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on the Sorcerer Spells Known Table. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.At 7th level, and every six levels thereafter, a sorcerer receives one bonus feat, chosen from a list specific to each bloodline.

,Sorcerer,"[[""Sorcerer""],[""Eldritch Scrapper""]]",Sorcerer (Eldritch Scrapper),Eldritch Scrapper,<sorcererbloodline_1,1,Martial Flexibility,"<p>At 1st level, an eldritch scrapper gains the brawler's martial flexibility class feature, using her sorcerer level as her brawler level for the purposes of uses per day. The scrapper treats Arcane Strike and Combat Casting as combat feats for the purpose of this ability.</p><p>At 9th level, an eldritch scrapper can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She can select one feat as a move action or two feats as a standard action. She can use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means she cannot replace the feat that is currently fulfilling another feat's prerequisites without also replacing all feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p><p>At 15th level, an eldritch scrapper can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She can select one feat as a swift action, two feats as a move action, or three feats as a standard action. She can use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat.

Her mongrel reservoir can hold an amount of magical energy equal to 3 + her sorcerer level. Each day when refreshing her spell slots, her mongrel reservoir is restored to full. The mongrel reservoir can never hold more points that the total mentioned above; points gained in excess of this maximum are lost.</p><p>Each day when she refreshes her spell slots, the mongrel mage selects one sorcerer bloodline. She must select an ordinary bloodline with this ability, not one altered by the wildblooded archetype or any other archetype. She gains this bloodline's 1st-level bloodline power for that day, using it as if she were only a 1st-level sorcerer. (If this ability is used to gain an arcane bond and the bonded item is selected, she can use the item only to cast a 1st-level spell known, as she counts as only a 1st-level sorcerer.) A mongrel mage can have only one bloodline selected at a time.</p><p>As a swift action, she can expend 1 point from her mongrel reservoir to activate that bloodline, allowing her to use its 1st-level bloodline powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her full sorcerer level, including using a bonded item from an arcane bond. This lasts for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p><p>At 3rd level, when activating her selected bloodline, a mongrel mage can instead spend 2 points from her mongrel reservoir to allow her to use the bloodline's 1st- and 3rd-level powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her full sorcerer level for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p><p>At 7th level, when a mongrel mage is activating her selected bloodline, the mongrel mage can instead spend 3 points from her mongrel reservoir, allowing her to use the bloodline's 1st-, 3rd-, and 7th-level powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her full sorcerer level for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus.</p><p>At 20th level, when activating her selected bloodline, a mongrel mage can instead spend 5 points from her mongrel reservoir, allowing her to use all of the bloodline's powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her full sorcerer level for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p><p>This ability alters the bloodline class feature, bloodline powers, and bloodline spells.</p><p>Bloodline Spells: At 7th level, each day when she selects her bloodline, a mongrel mage adds the 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rdlevel spells from her selected bloodline to her current list of spells known.</p><p>At 13th level, each day when she selects her bloodline, a mongrel mage adds the 4th-, 5th-, and 6th-level spells from her selected bloodline to her current list of spells known.</p><p>At 19th level, each day when she selects her bloodline, a mongrel mage adds the 7th-, 8th-, and 9th-level spells from her selected bloodline to her current list of spells known.</p><p>This ability replaces the bloodline feats gained at 7th, 13th, and 19th level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_14.jpg

If placed on a solid rock or stone surface, it instead lasts 1 minute per sorcerer level the stone warder has or until discharged. The stone warder cannot create a rune of warding in a square occupied by an existing rune of warding or another creature. The rune counts as a spell of the same level as the spell stored within it for the purposes of dispelling. It is considered a magic trap and can be discovered with a successful Perception check (DC = 25 + the level of the stored spell) and disarmed with a successful Disable Device check (DC = 25 + the level of the stored spell).

When a seeker applies a metamagic feat to any bonus spells granted by his mystery or his bloodline, he reduces the metamagic feat's spell level adjustment by 1. Thus, applying a Metamagic feat like Still Spell to a spell does not change its effective spell level at all, while applying Quicken Spell only increases the spell's effective spell level by 3 instead of by 4. This reduction to the spell level adjustment for Metamagic feats does not stack with similar reductions from other abilities. For an oracle, this ability replaces the revelation gained at 15th level.

In addition, at 1st level, a seeker adds half his oracle or sorcerer level on Perception checks made to locate traps and on all Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1). A seeker can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps. If the seeker also possesses levels in rogue or another class that provides the trapfinding ability, those levels stack with his oracle or sorcerer levels for determining his overall bonus on these skill checks.

A creature can make a wish as a free action at any time, even during the wishcrafter's turn. The wishcrafter must be able to hear and understand a wish in order to use it as a spell component. A spell that doesn't normally have a verbal component gains one when cast using this ability. A wish doesn't need to mention the name of a specific spell, but must describe an outcome that can be accomplished by casting a spell the wishcrafter knows (for example, wishing to be bigger could supply the verbal component for enlarge person). A wishcrafter gains a +1 bonus to her caster level when using a creature's wish as a verbal component in this manner, but cannot include herself as a target of such spells. She can be affected by such a spell if it affects an area rather than a target or targets. A wishcrafter is under no compulsion to grant a creature's wish.
