At 4th level, a sha'ir can concentrate for 1 full round and expend 1 point of mental focus stored in a jin to grant that jin all the statistics of a Small elemental of its type for 1 round per occultist level (this includes gaining any of the following abilities, if applicable: air mastery, burn, drench, earth glide, earth mastery, vortex, water mastery, and whirlwind). At 8th level, she can instead expend 2 points of mental focus to give one of her jin all the statistics of a Medium elemental. At 10th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Medium elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus, and the sha'ir can give a jin all the statistics of a Large elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 12th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Large elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus and the sha'ir can give a jin the statistics of a Huge elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 14th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Huge elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus and the sha'ir can give a jin the statistics of a greater elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 16th level, the sha'ir can give a jin the statistics of an elder elemental for 3 points of mental focus.

,Occultist,"[[""Occultist""],[""Tome Eater""]]",Occultist (Tome Eater),Tome Eater,<id-00033,1,Bonded Tome,"<p>At 1st level, a tome eater forms a supernatural bond with a specific book. She can replace her bonded tome with another book at any time, though the tome eater must perform a 24-hour binding ritual to attune herself to the new book.</p><p>The bonded tome starts as an implement for any two schools of magic at 1st level, and it gains access to additional schools of magic at 2nd, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, granting the tome eater access to base focus powers and resonant powers accordingly. The tome eater's bonded tome serves as her implement component to cast occultist spells of all schools she knows. However, she must split her mental focus among the schools she knows for the purpose of determining resonant powers and using focus powers, even though she possesses only one physical item as an implement. Once per day as part of casting an occultist spell, a tome eater can expend 1 point of mental focus tied to the appropriate school to increase the spell's caster level by 1 or increase the spell's DC by 1. A tome eater can enhance a spell in this manner one additional time per day at 6th level, and another time per day for every 5 occultist levels she possesses beyond 6th.

,Occultist,"[[""Occultist""],[""Secret Broker""]]",Occultist (Secret Broker),Secret Broker,<id-00021,2,Broker Secrets,"<p>At 2nd level, a secret broker can trade her secrets to another. For the purpose of this ability, an object's secret is composed of pieces of information gained from a single object through object reading, object seer, psychometry, or read object that the occultist didn't otherwise know and hasn't shared with another, written somewhere, or otherwise recorded or found a way to recover should she forget them and lose possession of the object. The secret broker can willingly use this ability in tandem with handing the object over to another creature in order to transfer the object's secret to that creature. The secret broker forgets the object's secret and the creature instantly learns the object's secret.</p><p>The secret broker can also destroy an object to remove his memory of the object's secret without transferring it to another. In either case, any onlookers who understand what the secret broker is doing, and the recipient in the case of a transfer, can intrinsically tell that the secret broker has used this ability rather than simply sharing the memory through other means or destroying the object but keeping its secret.</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-eye-purple.webp

The second focus power must take the same amount of time or less to activate than the first focus power, and the panoply savant must expend the normal mental focus cost to use the second focus power.</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-eye-purple.webp
,Occultist,"[[""Occultist""],[""Curator""]]",Occultist (Curator),Curator,<id-00026,8,Complex Collection,"<p>At 8th level, a curator can empower two relics that are in his collection simultaneously, and he gains the benefits of both. When he does so, he must allocate his relic collection's mental focus between the two relics.</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-eye-purple.webp
,Occultist,"[[""Occultist""],[""Planar Harmonizer""]]",Occultist (Planar Harmonizer),Planar Harmonizer,<id-00033,1,Conductor,"<p>A planar harmonizer gains access to only the conjuration school of implements, gaining a common tuning fork as her implement. She must select conjuration for her implement mastery. Each time she gains an occultist level, a planar harmonizer can add one conjuration spell from the wizard spell list to her occultist spell list and her list of spells known. The planar harmonizer can't choose a spell of a higher level than she is able to cast, and she adds the spell at the same spell level it appears on the wizard spell list. Additionally, she adds plane shift to her list as a 5th-level occultist spell. At 14th level, she doesn't gain an additional school of implements. Instead, at 14th level, the DCs of saving throws to resist a planar harmonizer's conjuration spells and conjuration focus powers increase by 2.

,Occultist,"[[""Occultist""],[""Construct Collector""]]",Occultist (Construct Collector),Construct Collector,<id-00003,3,Constructed Focus,"<p>At 3rd level, a construct collector can harvest components from destroyed constructs to fuel his implements. Harvesting a component takes 1 minute. A construct collector can harvest a number of active components equal to his Intelligence modifier per day. An active component is infused with 1 point of generic mental focus, which the construct collector can expend to activate any focus power at that power's normal cost, as opposed to the increased cost normally associated with generic mental focus. This otherwise functions as expending focus saved inside a construct collector's body. Once this mental focus is expended, the component becomes inactive and is useless. An unused component does not lose its mental focus, even after a construct collector refreshes his mental focus. A construct collector can initially have only one active component at a time. He can have two active components at a time at 9th level and three active components at a time at 15th level.</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-eye-purple.webp
,Occultist,"[[""Occultist""],[""Ancestral Aspirant""]]",Occultist (Ancestral Aspirant),Ancestral Aspirant,<id-00026,8,Courtly Contacts,"<p>Ancestral aspirants have contacts among courtly circles rather than otherworldly circles. This works similarly to outside contact except for the following differences: First, he doesn't need to use a magic circle or make a payment (though he still expends 1 point of mental focus from his enchantment implement). Second, he can use those contacts to gather information for him (as per the Diplomacy skill to gather information) without spending the time himself, rather than asking a question and receiving a result similar to a divination. He can ask more questions over the same time period at 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter, as normal with outside contact. At 16th level, instead of delivering messages and objects, the courtly contacts can spread vicious rumors and gossip about a target throughout a settlement, causing any creatures in the settlement whose attitude toward the target wasn't helpful to have its attitude toward the target worsened by one step. These baseless rumors last 1 week or until the target spends 8 hours refuting them and succeeds at a Diplomacy check (DC = 10 + the ancestral aspirant's occultist level + his Intelligence modifier).</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-eye-purple.webp
,Occultist,"[[""Occultist""],[""Occult Historian""]]",Occultist (Occult Historian),Occult Historian,<id-00027,12,Crumbling Strike,"<p>At 12th level, an occult historian can channel the erosion of countless ages into a single melee strike. As a full-round action, the occult historian can make a melee attack against a single target at her highest base attack bonus. If she hits, she deals 2d6 points of damage per occultist level she has (maximum 40d6). If the target succeeds at a Fortitude save (the save DC is equal to 10 + half the occult historian's occultist level + her Intelligence modifier), it takes only 5d6 points of damage. A creature slain by this attack crumbles to dust.

The necroccultist must consume at least one drop of the creature's blood, a small portion of its flesh, or a fragment of one of its bones as a part of this action. This ability otherwise functions as blood biography (Advanced Player's Guide 206), using the necroccultist's occultist level as his caster level. The necroccultist can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day for every 2 occultist levels thereafter.

At 1st level, the silksworn gains access to four implement schools instead of two. At 2nd level and every 4 occultist levels thereafter, the silksworn gains access to an additional implement school, to a maximum of nine schools at 18th level. At 8th, 12th, and 16th levels, the silksworn increases the number of spells of each level he can cast each day by one.

,Occultist,"[[""Occultist""],[""Tome Eater""]]",Occultist (Tome Eater),Tome Eater,<id-00018,4,Devour Books and Scrolls,"<p>A tome eater can devour books and scrolls in order to gain various benefits. Devouring a book or scroll is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A devoured book or scroll is absorbed into the tome eater's body and completely destroyed.</p><p>At 4th level, once per day a tome eater can devour a spell scroll or a book to regain mental focus, which she can divide as she likes among her schools of magic, to a maximum of the amount of mental focus she assigned to that school at the beginning of the day. If she devours a scroll, a tome eater regains a number of points of mental focus equal to the spell level of the highest-level spell contained on the scroll. If she devours a nonmagical book that contains at least 100 pages of written text and is worth at least 25 gp, a tome eater regains 1 point of mental focus. If she devours a magical book, she regains a number of points of mental focus equal to half the caster level of the item. If the tome eater devours a spellbook with at least 50 pages of spells of 1st level or higher, she regains 4 points of mental focus.</p><p>At 6th level, a tome eater can ready an action to devour an enemy's spell when an enemy within 30 feet attempts to cast a spell from a scroll. This ability works as the counterspell action as if the tome eater were using dispel magic, though the tome eater doesn't need to cast a spell to counter the enemy's spell. A tome eater can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 occultist levels beyond 6th. If a tome eater readies an action to use this ability and the readied action never triggers, she doesn't expend a daily use of this ability. At 16th level, the tome eater can use this ability as an immediate action without readying an action.</p><p>At 8th level, a tome eater can devour a book or scroll as a standard action. Additionally, whenever a tome eater successfully uses this ability to counter a spell being cast from a scroll, she can devour the enemy's scroll without spending any additional actions if she hasn't devoured a scroll or book yet that day.</p><p>At 12th level, a tome eater can devour a book or scroll as a move action. Additionally, whenever a tome eater successfully uses this ability to counter a spell being cast from a scroll, she can choose to turn the spell back on its caster (as spell turning) instead of devouring the scroll. She can do this whether or not she has devoured a scroll or book yet that day.</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-eye-purple.webp

The psychodermist must study at least one drop of the creature's blood, a small portion of its flesh, or a fragment of one of its bones as a part of this action. This ability otherwise functions as blood biographyAPG, using the psychodermist's occultist level as his caster level.

,Occultist,"[[""Occultist""],[""Secret Broker""]]",Occultist (Secret Broker),Secret Broker,<id-00030,12,Erase Secret,"<p>At 12th level, a secret broker can expend 1 point of mental focus from her divination implement in order to erase a fact from someone's mind by touch. This works similarly to modify memory to erase the memory of an event, except the effect is instantaneous and leaves no magical trace (it can still be removed by break enchantment, psychic surgeryOA, limited wish, miracle, or wish) and the secret broker can remove only one fact, such as 'The queen and the general are having an affair' rather than a 5-minute event.

,Occultist,"[[""Occultist""],[""Curator""]]",Occultist (Curator),Curator,<id-00033,1,Extensive Collection,"<p>At 1st level, a curator acquires a collection of esoteric relics that function as occultist implements associated with two schools of magic; he must select these schools and their associated spells when he gains this feature. As a move action, the curator can empower a single piece of his collection, choosing one of the two selected schools, gaining that school's focus power, and accessing the selected spells for 10 minutes. The curator can empower only a single relic at a time in this way, and activating this ability a second time ends any other relic's ongoing benefits. A curator's relic collection has a number of points of mental focus equal to his Intelligence modifier. Empowered relics are automatically invested with these mental focus points; expending a relic's mental focus reduces this total for the day. A curator can use this ability once per day. He can use it an additional time per day at 2nd level and every 4 levels thereafter. At 6th level and again at 14th level, a curator chooses two additional schools of magic-in addition to their spells- and adds them to his collection.</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-eye-purple.webp
,Occultist,"[[""Occultist""],[""Haunt Collector""]]",Occultist (Haunt Collector),Haunt Collector,<id-00025,8,Extricate Haunt,"<p>The haunt collector can temporarily exorcise his haunted implements' possessing entities to spontaneously create phenomena similar to haunts and imbue them with spells the occultist knows. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the haunt collector expends 1 point of mental focus to extricate an implement's spirit and infuse an adjacent square with its ghostly presence while granting it the power to deliver a spell from the implement's associated school (whose range is touch or greater) on the haunt collector's behalf. This action consumes the spell just as if it had been cast, but the energy is held in check by the created haunt until triggered by conditions set forth by the haunt collector. The conditions needed to trigger the haunt's spell effect must be clear, although they can be general, using the guidelines of the magic mouth spell. The haunt is stationary, and once the conditions for the trigger are met, the spell is discharged normally, though it now originates from the haunt's square.</p><p>The haunt itself is an invisible, incorporeal, spectral force, similar to a stationary unseen servant with an undead aura for the purposes of spells such as detect undead. It has a number of hit points equal to the double the level of the spell used to create it + the occultist's Intelligence modifier. If triggered during the same combat it is created, the haunt acts at initiative count 10; otherwise, when the trigger occurs, the haunt initiates combat and acts at initiative count 10 on the surprise round. Other creatures must succeed at a Perception check (DC = 10 + the haunt collector's occultist level) to act in the surprise round. The haunt can be damaged by positive energy and anything else that can harm haunts, and if destroyed before it is triggered, it dissipates harmlessly. If the haunt is destroyed, it does not reform in its haunted implement until the occultist next invests his implements with mental focus. If the haunt doesn't trigger before the occultist next invests his implements with mental focus, the haunt dissolves at that point and reforms in its haunted implement.</p><p>The haunt collector can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + his Intelligence modifier. While a haunting presence is extricated from its implement, the haunt collector does not receive the benefit of the implement's seance boon, nor can he call upon the implement's spirit bonus or use its focus powers, though he can still cast spells associated with the implement without penalty. If the spell is discharged successfully (rather than the haunt being destroyed), the spirit's presence returns to the haunt collector's implement the following round, and the seance boon and spirit bonus abilities are again available to the haunt collector.</p><p>At 12th level, the haunt collector can create a free-roaming haunt by expending an additional point of mental focus, granting it a fly speed of 10 feet with good maneuverability, which allows it to change locations or seek targets, under the restrictions for trigger conditions as outlined above. If the haunt wanders beyond medium range (measured from the haunt collector's current position), it is instantly destroyed.</p><p>At 16th level, the haunt collector can extricate an implement's spirit as a standard action.</p>",icons/sundries/books/book-eye-purple.webp

At any point during the day, she can shift any amount of her generic focus to any number of her implements by concentrating for 1 round while touching her implements. After every 10 minutes, her invested implements each lose 1 point of mental focus, as if it had been expended on a focus power.

Summoning the ghostly horde is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The ghostly horde appears within 60 feet of the necroccultist, fills an area 20 feet in diameter, and always hovers a few inches off the ground (thus ignoring any difficult terrain). The necroccultist can command the ghostly horde to move up to 30 feet each round as a move action, though the farthest edge of the ghostly horde can never be more than 60 feet from the necroccultist. Any creature caught inside the ghostly horde takes 1d6 points of damage per 2 occultist levels at the start of its turn (up to a maximum of 10d6 points of damage at 20th level). A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the necroccultist's occultist level + the necroccultist's Intelligence modifier) halves this damage.

No spells from any other school are considered to be on the occultist's spell list until he selects the associated implement school.

The occultist needs only one such item to cast spells of the corresponding school, unless he selected that implement school multiple times, in which case he needs one item for each set of spells gained from that school. Implements don't need to be magic items, and nonmagical implements don't take up a magic item slot even if they're worn.

When the occultist infuses a talisman with one of her spells, she expends the spell slot just as if she had cast the spell and expends any material components necessary. The talisman crafter can hurl this prepared talisman as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity and that requires the same thought and emotion components (Occult Adventures 144) as the original spell. Even if she can normally throw objects without provoking an attack of opportunity, throwing a talisman still provokes an attack of opportunity unless she also succeeds at a concentration check to cast defensively. The thrown talisman has a range of 20 feet, and the occultist must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit her target. If she hits the target,the spell affects it normally, and the creature receives the normal saving throw (if any) against the spell effect. This allows the talisman crafter to deliver touch spells at range through the spellbound talisman. Alternatively, the talisman crafter can touch the talisman to a target creature as a melee touch attack (for a willing target, she automatically hits); this attack doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity as long as she succeeds at a concentration check to cast defensively. If an inscribed talisman's spell would normally target more than one creature, its DC increases by 2.</p><p>Only a talisman crafter can activate her spellbound talismans.
