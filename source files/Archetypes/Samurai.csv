Whenever the ironbound sword takes a full defense action, she can expend an attack of opportunity to attempt to counter melee attacks made against her.

If the counter successfully hits the attacking enemy's AC and if the ironbound sword's attack roll is higher than the attacking creature's attack roll, the ironbound sword takes no damage from the enemy's attack and can initiate a disarm combat maneuver against the attacking enemy as a free action. If the triggering attack was made with a natural attack or unarmed strike, a successful disarm combat maneuver renders that natural attack or unarmed strike unusable until the victim spends a standard action to reset dislocated joints. In addition, the ironbound sword can spend one use of her resolve when she hits with a nonlethal attack to initiate a disarm combat maneuver against her target as a free action.</p>",icons/weapons/swords/sword-katana-purple.webp
