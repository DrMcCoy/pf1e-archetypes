A puppetmaster can learn bard spells from a formula book or spellbook (if they are also alchemist extracts or wizard spells) or a scroll (as if learning a wizard spell from a scroll), or can select them to be one or more of the two magus spells he adds to his spellbook at each magus level. This replaces knowledge pool and greater spell access.</p><p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the magus must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level.
