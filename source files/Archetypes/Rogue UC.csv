Members of a Bellflower crop must remain within 30 feet of the Bellflower irrigator to gain any benefits from abilities that affect a Bellflower crop, regardless of the ability's source (whether it's a Bellflower harvester, irrigator, or tiller).

The death attack fails if the target detects the Bellflower irrigator or recognizes him as an enemy. If the victim of the attack fails a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Bellflower irrigator's class level + the Bellflower irrigator's Intelligence modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per 2 rogue levels that the Bellflower irrigator has. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the Bellflower irrigator has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the irrigation attempt within the next 3 rounds. A Bellflower irrigator can attempt to kill or paralyze a creature in this way once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 additional rogue levels he has after 8th.</p>",icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-ritual-black.webp

She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack-not even with the usual -4 penalty.</p><p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot.
