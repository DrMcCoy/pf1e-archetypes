This alters the monk&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Chakra Training: A serpent-fire adept gains <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Chakra%20Initiate\">Chakra Initiate</a> and <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Psychic%20Sensitivity\">Psychic Sensitivity</a> as bonus feats. She need not meet these feats&rsquo; prerequisites, and can use her serpent-fire ki from Chakra Initiate to open and maintain her root chakra, despite not being 2nd level. This ability replaces stunning fist and the bonus feat gained at 1st level.<br /><br />Chakra Expertise (Ex): At 2nd level, the serpent-fire adept gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her monk level on Fortitude and Will saves attempted to maintain awakened chakras. At 8th level, when she has opened one or more chakras, she can maintain those chakras (without opening any new chakras) for 1 round without taking a swift action, expending ki, or attempting Fortitude or Will saves to maintain the chakras. This increases to 2 rounds at 16th level. After maintaining her chakras with chakra expertise, the monk must open a new chakra or maintain her open chakras normally before she can use chakra expertise again. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Light Spirit (Su): At 4th level when the serpent-fire adept has her sacral chakra open and chooses to benefit from its power, her fly speed is equal to either her base land speed or her bonus to her base speed from the monk fast movement class ability (whichever is higher). She maintains this fly speed for a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom bonus (minimum 1 round), even if she closes her chakras. This ability replaces the 4th-level ki power.<br /><br />Chakra Adept (Ex): At 6th level, the serpent-fire adept gains <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Chakra%20Adept\">Chakra Adept</a> as a bonus feat. She need not meet the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites. When the serpent-fire adept has used all her rounds of chakra expertise to maintain open chakras, if she does not spend additional ki to maintain her open chakras on the next round, her highest chakra closes and she can spend a swift action to use any one of the abilities of her remaining open chakras. On the round after that, all her chakras close, and if she wishes to reopen them, she must start again with her root chakra. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 6th level.<br /><br />Linked Chakras (Ex): At 8th level, the serpent-fire adept can open multiple chakras at once as a standard action. The round that she does this, she is required to make saving throws only to resist being overwhelmed by the highest chakra she opens, though the save DCs are increased by 5. She can do this once per day, plus one additional time per day each at 12th and 17th level. This ability replaces the 8th-level ki power.<br /><br />Chakra Mastery (Ex): At 10th level, the serpent-fire adept gains <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Chakra%20Master\">Chakra Master</a> as a bonus feat. She need not meet the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites. When maintaining her open chakras with chakra expertise, she can spend 1 point of ki to gain the benefits of two chakras rather than one in that round (or three chakras, if she has opened her crown chakra). At 14th level, the serpent-fire adept&rsquo;s pool of serpent-fire ki increases to 7 points, and at 18th level, it increases to 9 points.

In order to be admitted into the Monastery of Unblinking Flame and become one of these disciples, a supplicant must prove his worth by outwitting an efreeti. Those who succeed often become monks known as the brazen disciples.<br /><br />Brazen disciples believe that the best way to prepare for this test is to emulate the efreeti&rsquo;s own duplicitous ways. By studying genie contracts, brazen disciples learn how to take advantage of loopholes, and by pondering riddles, they learn how to obfuscate truth. They use deception in their fighting style, and many go a step further, incorporating fire and smoke both mundane and magical. Though most brazen disciples focus on joining the Houses of Perfection, some become enamored with the efreet and instead seek out genie masters.<br /><br />Class Skills: A brazen disciple gains Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha), and Knowledge (planes) (Int) as class skills but loses Knowledge (religion), Ride, and Swim.<br /><br />This alters the monk&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Feinting Flurry (Ex): When using flurry of blows to make melee attacks, a brazen disciple can forgo his first attack to attempt a Bluff check to feint. At 6th level, when a brazen disciple successfully feints, his opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC until the end of the monk&rsquo;s turn.<br /><br />This ability replaces the monk&rsquo;s bonus feats at 1st level and at 6th level.<br /><br />Bonus Feat: At 2nd, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, a brazen disciple can select a bonus feat. These feats must be chosen from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deceitful, Dodge, Elemental FistAPG, and Improved Initiative. At 6th level, the brazen disciple can also choose from the following feats: Efreeti StyleUC, Improved Dirty TrickAPG, Improved Disarm, Improved StealAPG, Improved Trip, and Mobility. At 10th level, the brazen disciple can also choose from the following feats: Efreeti StanceUC, Efreeti TouchUC, Improved Critical, and Spring Attack. He need not meet the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.<br /><br />This ability alters the monk&rsquo;s bonus feats.<br /><br />Efreeti&rsquo;s Guile (Ex): At 3rd level, a brazen disciple can add his Wisdom modifier on Bluff and Disguise checks instead of his Charisma modifier.<br /><br />This ability replaces still mind.<br /><br />Confounding Koan (Sp): At 12th level, a brazen disciple can spend 2 ki points as a standard action to confuse a target within 30 feet with a riddle or paradox. This ability functions as per confusion, except that it is language-dependent. The DC is equal to 10 + half the monk&rsquo;s class level + his Wisdom modifier, and the caster level is equal to his class level.<br /><br />This ability replaces the monk&rsquo;s ki ability gained at 12th level.<br /><br />Genie Apotheosis: At 20th level, a brazen disciple is treated as a native outsider with the fire subtype rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk&rsquo;s creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. He has immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold. Once per day, the brazen disciple can grant a limited wish (as per the spell limited wish) to a non-outsider as a spell-like ability (CL 20th).<br /><br />This ability replaces perfect self.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Monk (Unchained)","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/equipment/gloves.jpg","_id":"9q4dS82qN81H91LB"}

At 3rd level, the black asp&rsquo;s ability to use poison improves. He gains Adder StrikeUC as a bonus feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites.<br /><br />This ability replaces stunning fist and still mind.<br /><br />Forbidden Powers (Su): A black asp can select a forbidden ki power as a ki power. The black asp can select any of the following forbidden ki powers. <br /><br />Black Asp Venom (Su): As a swift action, a black asp with this ki power can poison his unarmed strike or a weapon in his hand.

{"name":"Monk UC (Invested Regent)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nda?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-of-the-High-Court\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Heroes of the High Court pg. 22</a><br />The invested regent has been handpicked by inscrutable divine forces to command others&mdash;either at the present or at some future time. The invested regent can harness a divine spark to perform superhuman stunts, influence others, and escape injury. Invested regents come from all races and walks of life, but they are more likely to be nobleborn in their cultures. Although some invested regents are acutely aware of their powers&rsquo; divine origins (such as powers gained from an investment ceremony to Asmodeus in the nation of Cheliax), others do not know the source of their abilities. Invested regents have strong personalities and a destiny to rule.<br /><br />Investiture (Su): An invested regent gains a pool of investiture points, supernatural energy he can use to call upon amazing abilities and divine protection. The number of points in the invested regent&rsquo;s investiture pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Charisma modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his investiture pool, the invested regent can select one of his saving throws as a swift action and gain a +1 sacred bonus on saving throws of that type for 1 round. If he spends 1 point from his investiture pool during this swift action, he instead gains a sacred bonus equal to his Charisma modifier on the saving throw selected.<br /><br />A character with this feature and the ki pool class feature tracks investiture points and ki points separately.<br /><br />This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 1st level.<br /><br />Vested Power (Ex or Sp): At 2nd level and every 4 monk levels thereafter, an invested regent can select a vested power (see the Vested Powers section below) for which he qualifies in place of selecting a monk bonus feat. The invested regent need not do so and can instead take the bonus feat, but once the decision to take a bonus feat or a vested power is made, he can&rsquo;t change it.<br /><br />This replaces the bonus feat the invested regent gives up for the vested power.<br /><br />Vested Powers: Vested powers are abilities that draw on an invested regent&rsquo;s investiture pool. Vested powers are divided into two categories: feats and spells.<br /><br />Requirements: All vested powers have a minimum level requirement to select them. An invested regent who hasn&rsquo;t reached the required monk level cannot select that vested power.<br /><br />Activation: Most vested powers require the invested regent to spend investiture points; the exact amount is listed after the vested power. Vested powers that cost 0 investiture points don&rsquo;t require the invested regent to have any investiture points in his investiture pool to use the ability. The saving throw against an invested regent&rsquo;s vested power, if any, is equal to 10 + 1/2 the invested regent&rsquo;s monk level + his Charisma bonus.<br /><br />Feats: These vested powers duplicate the effects of specific feats. An invested regent doesn&rsquo;t need to qualify for a feat to select it as a vested power. For example, an invested regent can select Spring Attack as a vested power even if he doesn&rsquo;t meet the prerequisites for selecting Spring Attack as a feat. Activating one of these vested powers is a free action on the invested regent&rsquo;s turn; until the start of his next turn, the invested regent is treated as if he had that feat.

{"name":"Monk UC (Softstrike Monk)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpya0b6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Martial Arts Handbook pg. 6</a><br />The practices of softstrike monks date back to the peaceful eras of Imperial Lung Wa. Still common among warriors today, softstrike monks employ a nonlethal but effective form of combat.<br /><br />Weapon Proficiency: A softstrike monk is proficient with the aklys, bolas, club, light flail, light mace, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sap, sling, and any weapon with the monk special quality that can deal bludgeoning damage. He is considered proficient only with monk weapons that can deal multiple types of damage when dealing bludgeoning damage.<br /><br />This replaces the monk&rsquo;s weapon proficiency.<br /><br />Feather Touch (Ex): A softstrike monk does not take the normal &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls for using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage. In addition, he can use his stunning fist ability while making a nonlethal attack with a weapon.<br /><br />Nonlethal Strikes (Ex): A softstrike monk focuses on blows that do not inflict deadly harm. When a softstrike monk deals nonlethal damage with his unarmed strikes, his monk level is treated as 4 levels higher for the purposes of determining the damage he deals (to a maximum of 4d8 at 20th level for a Medium monk). When dealing lethal damage with his unarmed strikes, his monk level is treated as if it were 4 levels lower (minimum 1st level) for the purpose of determining damage.<br /><br />This alters unarmed strike.<br /><br />Tenet of Life (Su): Though a softstrike monk accepts that death may happen in combat, he cannot abide killing in cold blood. If he slays an unconscious or helpless living foe, or merely stands by and allows such a killing to occur, he becomes shaken for 1 hour. In addition, the act disrupts the softstrike monk&rsquo;s ki; if he has a ki pool, he loses a number of ki points equal to half his level, as if they had been spent.<br /><br />Life-Giving Blows (Su): At 6th level, a softstrike monk can force a piece of his life force into a nonliving creature to disrupt its animating essence. If he hits an undead foe with an unarmed attack, he can spend 1 ki point as a free action to remove the target&rsquo;s immunity to nonlethal damage for a number of minutes equal to his Wisdom modifier. If, during this time, the target&rsquo;s nonlethal damage exceeds its current hit points, it is destroyed. At 10th level, a softstrike monk can also use this ability against constructs.<br /><br />This replaces the bonus feats gained at 6th and 10th levels.<br /><br />Wholeness of Body and Spirit (Su): At 7th level, a softstrike monk can use wholeness of body on both himself and other creatures, though it heals only nonlethal damage. If he uses this ability on an unconscious foe, he can spend 1 additional ki point to force the creature to accept a pact of life. The creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the softstrike monk&rsquo;s level + his Wisdom modifier) or the pact renders it unable to directly attack the monk and any allies within 60 feet, as per <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=sanctuary\">sanctuary</a>, for a number of days equal to the softstrike monk&rsquo;s level.<br /><br />This alters wholeness of body. (This ability applies only if the monk selects the wholeness of body ki power.)<br /><br />Incapacitating Palm (Su): At 15th level, a softstrike monk renders the target of his quivering palm unconscious instead of killing the creature. Upon failing its Fortitude saving throw, the target is knocked unconscious for a number of minutes equal to the softstrike monk&rsquo;s level.<br /><br />This alters quivering palm. (This ability applies only if the monk selects the quivering palm ki power.)<br /><br />Resilient Body (Su): At 19th level, a softstrike monk&rsquo;s mastery of nonlethal combat lets him apply his techniques to his defense. A softstrike monk converts any precision damage he takes to nonlethal damage.<br /><br />This replaces empty body.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Monk (Unchained)","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/equipment/gloves.jpg","_id":"zuNtiF7BG9uVCv9k"}
