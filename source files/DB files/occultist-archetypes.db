Construct collectors draw out that presence and use it to gain unlikely power in the battlefield.<br /><br />Constructed Focus (Su): At 3rd level, a construct collector can harvest components from destroyed constructs to fuel his implements. Harvesting a component takes 1 minute. A construct collector can harvest a number of active components equal to his Intelligence modifier per day. An active component is infused with 1 point of generic mental focus, which the construct collector can expend to activate any focus power at that power&rsquo;s normal cost, as opposed to the increased cost normally associated with generic mental focus. This otherwise functions as expending focus saved inside a construct collector&rsquo;s body. Once this mental focus is expended, the component becomes inactive and is useless. An unused component does not lose its mental focus, even after a construct collector refreshes his mental focus. A construct collector can initially have only one active component at a time. He can have two active components at a time at 9th level and three active components at a time at 15th level.<br /><br />This replaces the focus power selected at 3rd level, 9th level, and 15th level.<br /><br />Repower Construct (Su): At 8th level, a construct collector can use his mental focus to restore and gain control of a construct. As an immediate action, he can expend a number of points of generic mental focus (minimum 2 points) to prevent a construct within 30 feet from becoming destroyed when reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. The construct immediately regains a number of hit points equal to half of the construct collector&rsquo;s current hit points (minimum 1). The construct follows all of the construct collector&rsquo;s orders until the end of the collector&rsquo;s next turn or until reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. Afterwards, the construct is completely destroyed and cannot be repowered again, even by another construct collector. At 12th level, the construct is instead completely destroyed after a number of rounds equal to the number of points of generic mental focus expended. At 16th level, the construct is instead completely destroyed after a number of minutes equal to the number of points of generic mental focus expended.<br /><br />This replaces magic circles, outside contact, binding circles, and fast circles.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Occultist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-purple.jpg","_id":"1syXiQEIXQ2gdrpH"}

She is considered to have the <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Catch%20Off-Guard\">Catch Off-Guard</a> and <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Throw%20Anything\">Throw Anything</a> feats for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.<br /><br />Fleeting Focus (Su): An extemporaneous channeler&rsquo;s studies of the changing nature of objects give her more mental focus, which she learns to quickly invest in her implements throughout the day, but which she struggles to maintain. When an extemporaneous channeler refreshes her mental focus, she must spend 1 hour preparing her implements for spellcasting but does not immediately invest them with her generic focus, which is equal to her occultist level + twice her Intelligence modifier. At any point during the day, she can shift any amount of her generic focus to any number of her implements by concentrating for 1 round while touching her implements. After every 10 minutes, her invested implements each lose 1 point of mental focus, as if it had been expended on a focus power. If the extemporaneous channeler uses her withdraw focus ability to remove focus before a full 10-minute increment has elapsed, each implement still loses 1 point of mental focus as if it had been invested for that entire increment.<br /><br />This alters mental focus.<br /><br />Transformative Resonance (Su): An extemporaneous channeler can expend 1 point of generic focus as a swift action to allow her generic focus to resonate in her improvised weapons. For 1 minute, the extemporaneous channeler grants any item she uses as an improvised weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls for every 3 points of generic focus she has in her body. She can give it a maximum bonus of +1 at 1st level; the maximum bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels after 1st, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level. The extemporaneous channeler can imbue the item with any one weapon special ability with an equivalent enhancement bonus less than or equal to her maximum bonus by reducing the granted enhancement bonus by the appropriate amount, such as reducing a +2 bonus to a +1 <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Flaming\">flaming</a> enchantment. She chooses the special ability when she activates this power, but she can spend 1 point of generic focus as a swift action to change it, which also resets the duration of the power. The item must have an enhancement bonus of at least +1 (either on its own or from her imbuing it) to gain a weapon special ability. This ability stacks with any other effect that grants an enhancement bonus to an improvised weapon, such as <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Gloves%20of%20Improvised%20Might1\">gloves of improvised might</a>, to a maximum of +5.<br /><br />Withdraw Focus (Su): At 4th level, an extemporaneous channeler can, as a standard action, shift any amount of focus from any number of implements back into herself as generic focus. Doing so costs her no loss of focus (other than what&rsquo;s lost due to her fleeting focus ability). Unlike expending focus normally, this shift can reduce the effect of a resonant power in the implement from which the mental focus was taken.<br /><br />This alters shift focus.<br /><br />Improvised Spell (Su): At 8th level, an extemporaneous channeler learns to use her implements to improvise a spell similar to one she already knows. Once per day, an extemporaneous channeler can cast an occultist spell from an implement school she knows as if it were one of her spells known, expending a spell slot of the same level and an amount of generic focus equal to the spell&rsquo;s level to cast the desired spell. A spell cast as an improvised spell always has a minimum casting time of 1 round, regardless of the casting time of the spell. At 12th level, an extemporaneous channeler can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, she can use this ability three times per day.<br /><br />This replaces magic circles, outside contact, binding circles, and fast circles.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Occultist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-purple.jpg","_id":"4PbSEt3appUCrNE7"}
{"name":"Occultist (Tome Eater)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Occult Adventures pg. 102</a><br />Tome eaters have learned how to tap into the latent psychic energy of the written word by physically devouring books and scrolls to create magical effects and gain mystical insights. They use their bonded tomes to gain access to all sorts of magic, and as they grow in power, they gain an innate sense of the books and writings around them.<br /><br />Bonded Tome (Su): At 1st level, a tome eater forms a supernatural bond with a specific book. She can replace her bonded tome with another book at any time, though the tome eater must perform a 24-hour binding ritual to attune herself to the new book.<br /><br />The bonded tome starts as an implement for any two schools of magic at 1st level, and it gains access to additional schools of magic at 2nd, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, granting the tome eater access to base focus powers and resonant powers accordingly. The tome eater&rsquo;s bonded tome serves as her implement component to cast occultist spells of all schools she knows. However, she must split her mental focus among the schools she knows for the purpose of determining resonant powers and using focus powers, even though she possesses only one physical item as an implement. Once per day as part of casting an occultist spell, a tome eater can expend 1 point of mental focus tied to the appropriate school to increase the spell&rsquo;s caster level by 1 or increase the spell&rsquo;s DC by 1. A tome eater can enhance a spell in this manner one additional time per day at 6th level, and another time per day for every 5 occultist levels she possesses beyond 6th. This ability alters implements, mental focus, spellcasting, and implement mastery.<br /><br />Devour Books and Scrolls (Sp): A tome eater can devour books and scrolls in order to gain various benefits. Devouring a book or scroll is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A devoured book or scroll is absorbed into the tome eater&rsquo;s body and completely destroyed.<br /><br />At 4th level, once per day a tome eater can devour a spell scroll or a book to regain mental focus, which she can divide as she likes among her schools of magic, to a maximum of the amount of mental focus she assigned to that school at the beginning of the day. If she devours a scroll, a tome eater regains a number of points of mental focus equal to the spell level of the highest-level spell contained on the scroll. If she devours a nonmagical book that contains at least 100 pages of written text and is worth at least 25 gp, a tome eater regains 1 point of mental focus. If she devours a magical book, she regains a number of points of mental focus equal to half the caster level of the item. If the tome eater devours a spellbook with at least 50 pages of spells of 1st level or higher, she regains 4 points of mental focus.<br /><br />At 6th level, a tome eater can ready an action to devour an enemy&rsquo;s spell when an enemy within 30 feet attempts to cast a spell from a scroll. This ability works as the counterspell action as if the tome eater were using dispel magic, though the tome eater doesn&rsquo;t need to cast a spell to counter the enemy&rsquo;s spell. A tome eater can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 occultist levels beyond 6th. If a tome eater readies an action to use this ability and the readied action never triggers, she doesn&rsquo;t expend a daily use of this ability. At 16th level, the tome eater can use this ability as an immediate action without readying an action.<br /><br />At 8th level, a tome eater can devour a book or scroll as a standard action. Additionally, whenever a tome eater successfully uses this ability to counter a spell being cast from a scroll, she can devour the enemy&rsquo;s scroll without spending any additional actions if she hasn&rsquo;t devoured a scroll or book yet that day.<br /><br />At 12th level, a tome eater can devour a book or scroll as a move action. Additionally, whenever a tome eater successfully uses this ability to counter a spell being cast from a scroll, she can choose to turn the spell back on its caster (as spell turning) instead of devouring the scroll. She can do this whether or not she has devoured a scroll or book yet that day.<br /><br />This ability replaces shift focus, the implement gained at 6th level, magic circles, outside contact, binding circles, and fast circles.<br /><br />Word Sense (Sp, Su): At 5th level, a tome eater is constantly under the effect of read magic. Additionally, she can automatically detect the general topic of a piece of writing, and whether that writing is a magical scroll or tome, simply by looking at it. If she spends 1 round concentrating on a text within 30 feet per 100 pages of the text, she can gain a sense of a text&rsquo;s contents as if she had skimmed the text.

This alters the occultist&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A battle host is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all types of armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields). This replaces the occultist&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiency.<br /><br />Panoply Bond (Su): At 1st level, a battle host forms a supernatural bond with a specif ic weapon, suit of armor, or shield. This selection is permanent and can never be changed. The bonded item is masterwork quality and the battle host begins play with it at no cost. The bonded item is immune to the broken condition for as long as the battle host lives. If a battle host dies and is restored to life, the bonded item is also restored if it was destroyed. Any magic powers associated with a battle host&rsquo;s bonded item function only for the battle host; in the hands of anyone else it is only a masterwork item. The bonded item starts as an implement for any single school of magic at 1st level, and gains access to additional schools of magic at 2nd, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, granting the battle host access to base focus powers and resonant powers accordingly. The battle host&rsquo;s bonded item serves as his implement component to cast occultist spells of all the schools that he knows. However, he must split his mental focus among the schools he knows for the purpose of determining resonant powers and using focus powers, even though he possesses only one physical item as an implement. This ability alters implements, mental focus, spellcasting, and implement mastery.<br /><br />Battle Skill: At 2nd level, a battle host&rsquo;s magic item skill ability applies only on checks with weapons, armor, and shields. This ability alters magic item skill.<br /><br />Battle Reading: At 2nd level, a battle host can use object reading on only weapons, armor, and shields. This ability alters object reading.<br /><br />Bonus Feats: At 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th levels, a battle host gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats. The battle host must meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats. This ability replaces shift focus, magic circles, binding circles, and fast circles.<br /><br />Spirit Warrior (Sp): At 5th level, a battle host can call forth the spirit of a dead warrior who once owned his bonded item. Calling the spirit is a standard action, and unlike the use of most spell-like abilities, it doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity. This ability functions as spiritual ally (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide 246), using the battle host&rsquo;s occultist level as his caster level and his Intelligence modifier instead of his Wisdom modifier to determine the spell&rsquo;s effects. The battle host can summon a spirit warrior once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 occultist levels he possesses beyond 5th. This ability replaces aura sight.<br /><br />Heroic Splendor (Su): At 6th level, a battle host can draw power from his bonded item to imbue himself with superhuman strength, agility, or resilience. As a swift action, a battle host can grant himself a +4 insight bonus to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for 1 minute. The battle host can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 occultist levels he possesses beyond 6th. If he activates heroic splendor again before the duration expires, the new use of heroic splendor replaces the old use.

An occult historian seeks these ruins not only for their esoteric artifacts but also to learn the structures&rsquo; secrets.<br /><br />Ruin Reading (Su): At 2nd level, an occult historian can glean secrets from ruined structures. She must spend 1 minute examining and touching part of the structure (such as a wall or a doorframe). At the end of the minute, the occult historian attempts a Knowledge (history) check. If the ruin has been claimed as a lair for a creature, the DC of this check is equal to 10 + the CR of the most powerful creature in the ruin. If the ruin holds a magic item (or multiple magic items), the DC of this check is equal to 11 + the highest caster level of all the magic items in the ruin. If the occult historian succeeds at the check, she learns the layout of the area of the ruin within 30 feet of her (including any secret doors), as well as a piece of information about the structure&rsquo;s history (as determined by the GM).<br /><br />At 5th level, the occult historian can see into a ruin&rsquo;s past. This reveals the same information that can be gathered with the spell retrocognition, except the occult historian can use it only in ruins. If the occult historian succeeds at the check outlined above, she sees the events that occurred in the ruin over the past hour; for each minute she concentrates, she can see 1 additional hour into the ruin&rsquo;s past. If the result of her check exceeds the DC by 5 or more, she can see the events that occurred over the past week, plus for 1 additional week per minute she concentrates. If the result of her check exceeds the DC by 10 or more, she can see the events of the past year, plus for 1 additional year per minute she concentrates. If the result of her check exceeds the DC by 20 or more, she can see the events of the past century, plus for 1 additional century per minute she concentrates.<br /><br />An occult historian can use ruin reading once per day, plus an additional time every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of five times per day at 18th level.<br /><br />This replaces object reading and aura sight.<br /><br />Trap Sense (Ex): At 3rd level, an occult historian gains trap sense +1, as per the rogue class feature of the same name. This bonus improves by 1 for every 3 occultist levels gained after 3rd, to a maximum of +6 at 18th level. This replaces the focus power gained at 3rd level.<br /><br />Crumbling Strike (Su): At 12th level, an occult historian can channel the erosion of countless ages into a single melee strike. As a full-round action, the occult historian can make a melee attack against a single target at her highest base attack bonus. If she hits, she deals 2d6 points of damage per occultist level she has (maximum 40d6). If the target succeeds at a Fortitude save (the save DC is equal to 10 + half the occult historian&rsquo;s occultist level + her Intelligence modifier), it takes only 5d6 points of damage. A creature slain by this attack crumbles to dust.

When he selects a haunted implement, he forsakes the resonant power from the item&rsquo;s implement group and instead selects a spirit from the medium&rsquo;s list of spirits (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 33), gaining that spirit&rsquo;s seance boon in place of the resonant power. He can also call upon the implement&rsquo;s haunting entity as a swift action to temporarily gain bonuses on all checks associated with the selected legendary spirit&rsquo;s spirit bonus for 1 round. This spirit bonus is equal to 1/2 the amount of mental focus invested in the implement, to a maximum bonus of 1 + 1 for every 4 occultist levels the haunt collector has. He can call upon this spirit bonus a number of times per day equal to the amount of mental focus invested in the implement, though invoking it doesn&rsquo;t expend any mental focus. Once the spirit type is selected for an implement, it cannot be changed.<br /><br />This ability alters implements.<br /><br />Hauntist (Su): At 5th level, a haunt collector with at least one haunted implement gains the medium&rsquo;s haunt channeler class feature (Occult Adventures 31), with an effective medium level equal to his occultist level &ndash; 2.<br /><br />This ability replaces aura sight. <br /><br />Spirit Speaker (Sp): At 8th level, a haunt collector with at least one haunted implement can commune with the spirits once per day. By holding a seance for 10 minutes, he can ask questions of a destroyed undead or a neutralized or destroyed haunt. To use this ability on a corporeal undead, the haunt collector must have the creature&rsquo;s head in his possession. For a haunt or incorporeal undead, this seance must be held in the haunt&rsquo;s location or where the incorporeal undead was destroyed. Treat this ability as speak with hauntACG or as speak with dead (but affecting only destroyed undead rather than only corpses), using the haunt collector&rsquo;s occultist level as the caster level. He can perform this seance one additional time per day at 12th level, and again at 16th level and 20th level.<br /><br />This ability replaces outside contact.<br /><br />Extricate Haunt (Su): The haunt collector can temporarily exorcise his haunted implements&rsquo; possessing entities to spontaneously create phenomena similar to haunts and imbue them with spells the occultist knows. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the haunt collector expends 1 point of mental focus to extricate an implement&rsquo;s spirit and infuse an adjacent square with its ghostly presence while granting it the power to deliver a spell from the implement&rsquo;s associated school (whose range is touch or greater) on the haunt collector&rsquo;s behalf. This action consumes the spell just as if it had been cast, but the energy is held in check by the created haunt until triggered by conditions set forth by the haunt collector. The conditions needed to trigger the haunt&rsquo;s spell effect must be clear, although they can be general, using the guidelines of the magic mouth spell. The haunt is stationary, and once the conditions for the trigger are met, the spell is discharged normally, though it now originates from the haunt&rsquo;s square.<br /><br />The haunt itself is an invisible, incorporeal, spectral force, similar to a stationary unseen servant with an undead aura for the purposes of spells such as detect undead. It has a number of hit points equal to the double the level of the spell used to create it + the occultist&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier. If triggered during the same combat it is created, the haunt acts at initiative count 10; otherwise, when the trigger occurs, the haunt initiates combat and acts at initiative count 10 on the surprise round. Other creatures must succeed at a Perception check (DC = 10 + the haunt collector&rsquo;s occultist level) to act in the surprise round. The haunt can be damaged by positive energy and anything else that can harm haunts, and if destroyed before it is triggered, it dissipates harmlessly. If the haunt is destroyed, it does not reform in its haunted implement until the occultist next invests his implements with mental focus. If the haunt doesn&rsquo;t trigger before the occultist next invests his implements with mental focus, the haunt dissolves at that point and reforms in its haunted implement.<br /><br />The haunt collector can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + his Intelligence modifier. While a haunting presence is extricated from its implement, the haunt collector does not receive the benefit of the implement&rsquo;s seance boon, nor can he call upon the implement&rsquo;s spirit bonus or use its focus powers, though he can still cast spells associated with the implement without penalty. If the spell is discharged successfully (rather than the haunt being destroyed), the spirit&rsquo;s presence returns to the haunt collector&rsquo;s implement the following round, and the seance boon and spirit bonus abilities are again available to the haunt collector.<br /><br />At 12th level, the haunt collector can create a free-roaming haunt by expending an additional point of mental focus, granting it a fly speed of 10 feet with good maneuverability, which allows it to change locations or seek targets, under the restrictions for trigger conditions as outlined above. If the haunt wanders beyond medium range (measured from the haunt collector&rsquo;s current position), it is instantly destroyed.<br /><br />At 16th level, the haunt collector can extricate an implement&rsquo;s spirit as a standard action.<br /><br />This ability replaces magic circles, binding circles, and fast circles.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Occultist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-purple.jpg","_id":"SgD5II8eYCdD4WjG"}

They draw their power from wearing luxurious garments and can be found in many noble courts throughout Golarion, though they often keep their abilities secret. Silksworn are even found among the mystics and the magical practitioners of Nex, each seeking the patronage of one or more of the Arclords.<br /><br />Class Skills: A silksworn adds Bluff and Knowledge (nobility) to his list of class skills, instead of Knowledge (engineering) and Knowledge (planes).<br /><br />This alters the occultist&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Spells: A silksworn&rsquo;s spells are considered arcane spells, not psychic spells, and his spells use verbal and somatic components instead of thought and emotion components.<br /><br />This alters the occultist&rsquo;s spells.<br /><br />Implements: When a silksworn chooses an implement school, he does not choose a specific object. Instead, a silksworn must be wearing an ostentatious garment or magic item worth 10 gp or more of the appropriate type and in the appropriate slot: abjuration (wrists), conjuration (shoulders), divination (eyes), enchantment (neck), evocation (hands), illusion (head), necromancy (chest), and transmutation (feet). A silksworn who does not meet this requirement is treated as lacking the appropriate implement for the purpose of his class features, including spellcasting.<br /><br />This alters the occultist&rsquo;s implements.<br /><br />Cantrips: Each time he selects an implement school, a silksworn gains one cantrip, or 0-level arcane spell (including when he selects a school that he has already learned to use). These cantrips otherwise behave as an occultist&rsquo;s knacks.<br /><br />This ability replaces knacks.<br /><br />Mental Focus (Su): The silksworn&rsquo;s available mental focus is equal to his occultist level + his Intelligence modifier + his Charisma modifier.<br /><br />This ability alters mental focus.<br /><br />Devoted Mystic: A silksworn is proficient with only simple weapons and isn&rsquo;t proficient with any armor or shields. At 1st level, the silksworn gains access to four implement schools instead of two. At 2nd level and every 4 occultist levels thereafter, the silksworn gains access to an additional implement school, to a maximum of nine schools at 18th level. At 8th, 12th, and 16th levels, the silksworn increases the number of spells of each level he can cast each day by one. This does not allow the silksworn to cast spells of a level he does not yet have access to.<br /><br />This ability alters implements and the occultist&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiencies, and replaces outside contact.<br /><br />Silksworn Eloquence (Ex): At 8th level, a silksworn gains a +1 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks for each magical article of clothing occupying one of his implement schools&rsquo; magic item slots.<br /><br />This ability replaces magic circles.<br /><br />Silksworn Deception (Su): At 12th level, a silksworn can hide his speech and gestures within his extravagant clothing. Whenever the silksworn casts a spell, he can attempt a Bluff check opposed by Sense Motive checks from those observing him. Those who fail are unaware of his spellcasting, unless an effect obviously originates from the silksworn.<br /><br />This ability replaces binding circles.<br /><br />Silksworn Arcana (Su): At 16th level, when a silksworn casts a spell while wearing a magic article of clothing in the appropriate school&rsquo;s magic item slot, the spell&rsquo;s saving throw DC increases by 2.<br /><br />This ability replaces fast circles.<br /><br />Implement Mastery (Su): At 20th level, a silksworn chooses two implement schools instead of one, and implement mastery&rsquo;s effects apply to both.

A sha&rsquo;ir&rsquo;s jin is both a precious ally and a living implement for its master.<br /><br />Jin (Su): At 1st level, a sha&rsquo;ir learns how to contact a jin&mdash;a minor, insubstantial genie that makes its home on the elemental planes. She learns how to contact a second jin at 6th level and a third jin at 14th level. Each of these jin is connected to one of the eight schools of magic, just like an occultist implement, but also to the air, earth, fire, or water school (Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide 142). Each jin works like a living implement for both of its schools. To provide the implement component for a spell or focus power, a jin must be within 30 feet of its master.<br /><br />The elemental schools don&rsquo;t have focus powers or resonant powers. Instead, the sha&rsquo;ir considers all wizard spells of 6th level and lower from the lists corresponding to her jin&rsquo;s elemental schools to be on her occultist spell list. In addition, she adds additional spells to her list of spells known. For every spell level she can cast, she adds one spell from each jin&rsquo;s elemental school and one spell from each jin&rsquo;s non-elemental school.<br /><br />A jin in its natural form has the base statistics of a Small elemental of the chosen type with the young simple template and without the air mastery, burn, drench, earth glide, earth mastery, vortex, water mastery, or whirlwind abilities.<br /><br />At 20th level, a sha&rsquo;ir selects one of her jin and chooses one of its two schools instead of selecting an implement for implement mastery.<br /><br />If one of her jin is slain, the sha&rsquo;ir is treated as if she didn&rsquo;t have the appropriate implement to cast the spells associated with that jin. The sha&rsquo;ir can replace the slain jin the following morning by expending 1 point of mental focus in a special ritual that takes 1 hour to perform.<br /><br />This ability replaces implements and alters mental focus, spellcasting, and implement mastery.<br /><br />Augment Jin (Sp, Su): Starting at 2nd level, a sha&rsquo;ir&rsquo;s jin uses its master&rsquo;s base saving throws if they are better than its own, and it uses either its own hit point total or 1/2 its master&rsquo;s hit points, whichever is higher. At 4th level, a sha&rsquo;ir can concentrate for 1 full round and expend 1 point of mental focus stored in a jin to grant that jin all the statistics of a Small elemental of its type for 1 round per occultist level (this includes gaining any of the following abilities, if applicable: air mastery, burn, drench, earth glide, earth mastery, vortex, water mastery, and whirlwind). At 8th level, she can instead expend 2 points of mental focus to give one of her jin all the statistics of a Medium elemental. At 10th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Medium elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus, and the sha&rsquo;ir can give a jin all the statistics of a Large elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 12th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Large elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus and the sha&rsquo;ir can give a jin the statistics of a Huge elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 14th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Huge elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus and the sha&rsquo;ir can give a jin the statistics of a greater elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 16th level, the sha&rsquo;ir can give a jin the statistics of an elder elemental for 3 points of mental focus. This ability replaces magic item skill and object reading.<br /><br />Manifest Jin (Su): At 7th level, the sha&rsquo;ir can designate one of her jin and manifest its powers, allowing it to count as a Small elemental at all times, as if using augment jin to augment it to a Small elemental but with a permanent duration. By concentrating for 1 full round, she can change which of her jin she manifests in this way. This ability replaces aura sight.<br /><br />Jin Spy (Su): At 8th level, when a sha&rsquo;ir gains her outside contact ability, instead of learning the true names of outsiders, she can ask one or more of her jin to perform tasks. She chooses from the same tasks listed under outside contact (as appropriate to her occultist level). This doesn&rsquo;t require negotiation or gifts, but the jin is not available to the sha&rsquo;ir during the time it spends performing these tasks. This ability alters outside contact.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Occultist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-purple.jpg","_id":"WQKjwgIK2kqLuih0"}

The talisman crafter selects schools as normal (two at 1st level and an additional one at 2nd level and every 4 occultist levels thereafter). She creates one master talisman for each implement school she knows, unless she selected that implement school multiple times, in which case she needs one master talisman per time she has selected that school. The talisman crafter splits her mental focus among the schools she knows and generic focus as normal.<br /><br />This ability alters implements.<br /><br />Spellbound Tailsman (Su): At 2nd level, a talisman crafter can inscribe spellbound talismans in addition to her master talismans, infusing small tokens she crafts with psychic spells she knows that normally affect one or more target creatures (but not spells that target the caster, spells that affect an area, spells that create effects, or other such spells). When the occultist infuses a talisman with one of her spells, she expends the spell slot just as if she had cast the spell and expends any material components necessary. The talisman crafter can hurl this prepared talisman as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity and that requires the same thought and emotion components (Occult Adventures 144) as the original spell. Even if she can normally throw objects without provoking an attack of opportunity, throwing a talisman still provokes an attack of opportunity unless she also succeeds at a concentration check to cast defensively. The thrown talisman has a range of 20 feet, and the occultist must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit her target. If she hits the target,the spell affects it normally, and the creature receives the normal saving throw (if any) against the spell effect. This allows the talisman crafter to deliver touch spells at range through the spellbound talisman. Alternatively, the talisman crafter can touch the talisman to a target creature as a melee touch attack (for a willing target, she automatically hits); this attack doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity as long as she succeeds at a concentration check to cast defensively. If an inscribed talisman&rsquo;s spell would normally target more than one creature, its DC increases by 2.<br /><br />Only a talisman crafter can activate her spellbound talismans. Once created, a spellbound talisman remains potent until the next time the talisman crafter regains spell slots before losing its magic. Inscribing a spellbound talisman in this manner takes 1 minute of work.<br /><br />This ability replaces magic item skill and object reading.<br /><br />Shared Talisman (Su): At 4th level, a talisman crafter can expend 1 point of generic mental focus to create a spellbound talisman that anyone can activate. As long as the spellbound talisman exists, it continues to occupy one of the occultist&rsquo;s spell slots, but can be used by another creature to trigger its effects. Whoever triggers the effect, a shared talisman does not require thought or emotion components, and it doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity for casting a spell (though it still does so as normal if thrown).<br /><br />This ability replaces shift focus.<br /><br />Warding Seal (Su): At 5th level, a talisman crafter can inscribe a warding seal, infusing an inscribed glyph with psychic energy. Inscribing the seal follows the rules for drawing magic circles, takes 1 minute, and requires the occultist to expend 1 point of mental focus (either generic focus or focus from any one of her implements). As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the talisman crafter expends 1 point of mental focus to scribe a special seal, infusing the glyph with a psychic spell she knows that affects one or more creatures and expending the spell slot just as if she had cast the spell. This seal holds the spell energy in check until it&rsquo;s triggered by conditions set forth when the seal is crafted or until the occultist refreshes her mental focus. The seal functions as the spell glyph option of the glyph of warding spell. At 17th level, the talisman crafter&rsquo;s fast circles ability applies to her warding seals, and she treats the ability as the greater spell glyph option of the greater glyph of warding spell.<br /><br />This ability replaces aura sight and the focus powers normally gained at 5th and 17th levels.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Occultist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-purple.jpg","_id":"XKNIGHA7bLpF8O2F"}

A lucky few join wealthy organizations replete with relics or inherit undocumented vaults full of historical treasures, and dabble in a wide variety of implements while mastering few. This is especially common in the Aspis Consortium, whose far-flung merchants handle countless relics every year. It&rsquo;s simple enough to snag choice items from Aspis ships, allowing these curators to compile truly prodigious collections. While all agents of the Aspis Consortium are expected to catalog and file their discoveries, in practice many of them keep prizes for their personal use, and the curator has elevated this practice almost to an art form. When confronted by superiors with accusations of failing to hand over rare treasures or mysterious items, the curator is swift to point out that such objects do the group no good sitting on a dusty shelf. Instead, the curator lives up to his name, and seeks to access the ancient powers hidden in such objects so that he can use them in the best interest of the Aspis Consortium. Over time, the Consortium has been forced to admit the wisdom in this way of thinking.<br /><br />Extensive Collection (Su): At 1st level, a curator acquires a collection of esoteric relics that function as occultist implements associated with two schools of magic; he must select these schools and their associated spells when he gains this feature. As a move action, the curator can empower a single piece of his collection, choosing one of the two selected schools, gaining that school&rsquo;s focus power, and accessing the selected spells for 10 minutes. The curator can empower only a single relic at a time in this way, and activating this ability a second time ends any other relic&rsquo;s ongoing benefits. A curator&rsquo;s relic collection has a number of points of mental focus equal to his Intelligence modifier. Empowered relics are automatically invested with these mental focus points; expending a relic&rsquo;s mental focus reduces this total for the day. A curator can use this ability once per day. He can use it an additional time per day at 2nd level and every 4 levels thereafter. At 6th level and again at 14th level, a curator chooses two additional schools of magic&mdash;in addition to their spells&mdash; and adds them to his collection.<br /><br />This ability replaces one of the two occultist implements learned at 1st level as well as the implements learned at 6th level and 14th level.<br /><br />Split Focus (Su): A curator has a number of points of mental focus equal to only his occultist level.<br /><br />This ability alters mental focus.<br /><br />Adaptable Powers (Su): At 3rd level, a curator learns one focus power from each of the schools associated with his extensive collection. Whenever he activates his collection, he can use those focus powers associated with his selected school of magic while the relic remains empowered. Whenever the curator would learn another focus power for an implement, he can instead select two new focus powers from different schools associated with his extensive relic collection.<br /><br />This ability replaces the focus power gained at 3rd level.<br /><br />Relic Resistance (Ex): At 4th level, a curator develops a resistance to harmful items. He never gains negative levels due to his alignment as a result of wielding or wearing magic items, and he gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resolve personality conflicts with intelligent magic items. Whenever a cursed item&rsquo;s harmful condition would trigger, a curator can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + the item&rsquo;s CL) to suppress the curse just long enough to discard the item before it activates. Finally, when identifying an item, a curator needs to exceed the item&rsquo;s DC by only 5 (instead of 10) to determine whether the item is cursed.<br /><br />This ability replaces shift focus.<br /><br />Complex Collection (Su): At 8th level, a curator can empower two relics that are in his collection simultaneously, and he gains the benefits of both. When he does so, he must allocate his relic collection&rsquo;s mental focus between the two relics.<br /><br />This ability replaces outsider contact.<br /><br />Mental Catalog (Su): At 8th level, the points of mental focus invested in the curator&rsquo;s relic collection increase by 2. This total increases by 1 additional point at 12th level and 16th level.<br /><br />This ability replaces an occultist&rsquo;s magic circles, binding circles, and fast circles.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Occultist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-purple.jpg","_id":"bKlB6dOh25RhIhaB"}

Some find faith first, and draw out the divine potential in religious relics. Many see these religious scholars as eccentrics or heretics who pilfer holy magic with their bizarre rituals.<br /><br />Faithful: A reliquarian must worship a deity, and must be within one step of her deity&rsquo;s alignment, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis. A reliquarian is proficient with her deity&rsquo;s favored weapon in addition to her normal weapon and armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Spells: A reliquarian&rsquo;s spells are considered divine spells, not psychic spells. The reliquarian&rsquo;s spells use verbal components instead of thought components, and somatic components instead of emotional components, and she uses a sacred implement (see below) as a divine focus. This ability alters the occultist&rsquo;s spells.<br /><br />Domain: A reliquarian gains access to one of her deity&rsquo;s domains. She treats her occultist level as her cleric level for the purposes of access to domain powers and their strength. Additionally, the reliquarian adds the domain&rsquo;s spells to her occultist spell list and her spells known.<br /><br />Diminished Focus Power (Su): A reliquarian learns only the base focus power from one implement school at 1st level. She gains additional focus powers as normal. This ability alters focus powers.<br /><br />Sacred Implements (Su): A reliquarian gains one implement school at 1st level. Additionally, the reliquarian gains a relic of her god, typically a holy symbol of significant age, a fixture from a lost temple, or bone or hair from a prominent historical figure of the religion. This grants the reliquarian access to one of her deity&rsquo;s domains, as detailed above. Without this implement, the reliquarian cannot use her domain powers and must succeed at a Concentration check to cast spells from her domain. All of a reliquarian&rsquo;s future implements must be somehow representative of her faith. This ability modifies implements.<br /><br />Orisons: A reliquarian gains one orison, or 0-level divine spell, each time she selects an implement school (including when she again selects a school that she has already learned to use.) These orisons otherwise behave as an occultist&rsquo;s knacks.

If the book is damaged, it is restored to full hit points when the initiate&rsquo;s mental focus refreshes. If the book is lost or destroyed, the initiate can replace it with another similar one, but doing so requires an 8-hour ritual that binds the new book to him.<br /><br />The book serves as an implement for any two schools of magic at 1st level. The initiate gains new implement schools normally. However, the initiate&rsquo;s additional implements must be masterwork or magic items worth at least 50 gp, and they must directly or nominally represent the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye&rsquo;s beliefs or history. For example, the initiate&rsquo;s implements could be Osirian antiques, trinkets covered in Palatine iconography, or the like. When the initiate benefits from his implements&rsquo; resonant powers, he treats his occultist level as 1 higher for the purpose of determining the powers&rsquo; benefits only.<br /><br />An esoteric initiate can&rsquo;t save generic mental focus inside his own body instead of investing all of it. At 4th level, when the initiate gains the ability to shift his mental focus from one implement to another, he loses no focus when doing so.<br /><br />This alters mental focus, implements, and shift focus.<br /><br />Symbolism (Sp): At 5th level, an initiate who spends 1 minute carefully studying any written work can understand its gist even if he doesn&rsquo;t speak the language in which the text is written. A number of times per day equal to the initiate&rsquo;s occultist level, the initiate can cast comprehend languages as a spell-like ability to read a written work, using his occultist level as his caster level.

They contact and learn from the dead, rather than from items or outsiders, allowing them to drain the life of their foes to feed their own power, and even call forth phantasmal hordes of spirits to destroy their enemies.<br /><br />Necromantic Bond (Su): At 1st level, a necroccultist gains access to only the necromancy school of implements. He must select necromancy for his implement mastery. Each time he gains an occultist level, a necroccultist can add one necromancy spell from the wizard spell list to his occultist spell list and his list of spells known. The necroccultist can&rsquo;t choose a spell of a higher level than he is able to cast, and he adds the spell at the same spell level it appears on the wizard spell list. At 14th level, he doesn&rsquo;t gain an additional school of implements. Instead, at 14th level, the DCs of saving throws to resist a necroccultist&rsquo;s necromancy spells and necromancy focus powers increase by 2. This ability alters implements and implement mastery.<br /><br />Deadspeaker (Su): At 2nd level, as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a necroccultist can learn the answers to a specific set of questions concerning a dead or undead creature. The necroccultist must consume at least one drop of the creature&rsquo;s blood, a small portion of its flesh, or a fragment of one of its bones as a part of this action. This ability otherwise functions as blood biography (Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide 206), using the necroccultist&rsquo;s occultist level as his caster level. The necroccultist can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day for every 2 occultist levels thereafter. This ability replaces object reading.<br /><br />Ghostly Horde (Su): At 5th level, a necroccultist can spend 1 point of mental focus from a necromancy implement to summon a mob of ghostly spirits to harass his enemies. Summoning the ghostly horde is a standard action that doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity. The ghostly horde appears within 60 feet of the necroccultist, fills an area 20 feet in diameter, and always hovers a few inches off the ground (thus ignoring any difficult terrain). The necroccultist can command the ghostly horde to move up to 30 feet each round as a move action, though the farthest edge of the ghostly horde can never be more than 60 feet from the necroccultist. Any creature caught inside the ghostly horde takes 1d6 points of damage per 2 occultist levels at the start of its turn (up to a maximum of 10d6 points of damage at 20th level). A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the necroccultist&rsquo;s occultist level + the necroccultist&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier) halves this damage. This damage is not negative energy&mdash;it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches as if from supernatural aging. Nonliving creatures and creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. The ghostly horde remains for 1 round, though at the beginning of his turn, the necroccultist can expend 1 point of mental focus as a swift action to extend the duration for 1 additional round. The necroccultist can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day for every 5 occultist levels thereafter. This ability replaces aura sight.<br /><br />Life Drain (Sp): At 8th level, a necroccultist can expend 1 point of mental focus from a necromancy implement to unleash a life-draining ray as a ranged touch attack that causes the target to accrue 1d4 negative levels. The ray has a range of 60 feet. The negative levels last a number of minutes equal to the necroccultist&rsquo;s occultist level. For each negative level this attack gives a target, the necroccultist regains a number of hit points equal to his occultist level. The necroccultist can use this ability once per day at 8th level, plus one additional time per day for every 3 occultist levels thereafter. This ability replaces outside contact.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Occultist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-purple.jpg","_id":"dCObkOMkPHeNr3n6"}

Through these mementos, these occultists manifest not only their own magic, but also the unique powers of their fallen foes.<br /><br />Class Skills: A psychodermist loses Disable Device, Knowledge (engineering), Knowledge (history), and Sleight of Hand as class skills, and adds Heal, Knowledge (nature), Knowledge (local), and Survival as class skills.<br /><br />This alters the occultist&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Trophies (Su): At 1st level, a psychodermist learns how to siphon power from pieces of creatures he has slain. The psychodermist gains Harvest Parts as a bonus feat, and he can select one monster part per implement school he knows to become a permanently preserved trophy so long as it remains in his possession. Each trophy functions as the psychodermist&rsquo;s implement for its associated implement school. A trophy that fits multiple implement categories, such as a hand with clawed fingers, can function for only one implement school at a time. A trophy can be integrated into another item, such as an ornament or a magic item, but otherwise does not take up a magic item slot, even when worn. A psychodermist can replace trophies with new ones harvested from slain foes, although doing so causes the old trophies to rot at their normal rate. In order to craft a trophy, the psychodermist must have been present during the creature&rsquo;s death.<br /><br />This ability alters implements.<br /><br />Monster Hunting Lore (Ex): At 2nd level, a psychodermist gains a bonus equal to half his occultist level on skill checks made to craft trophies and Knowledge checks made to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.<br /><br />This ability replaces magic item skill.<br /><br />Discern Death (Su): At 2nd level, as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a psychodermist can glean information from a creature&rsquo;s corpse. The psychodermist must study at least one drop of the creature&rsquo;s blood, a small portion of its flesh, or a fragment of one of its bones as a part of this action. This ability otherwise functions as blood biographyAPG, using the psychodermist&rsquo;s occultist level as his caster level. The psychodermist can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day for every 3 levels beyond 2nd.<br /><br />This ability replaces object reading.<br /><br />Seek Prey (Su): At 5th level, a psychodermist can supernaturally detect creatures around him as a standard action. This functions as the spell aura sightACG, except the duration is 1 round and the psychodermist learns the locations and power of all auras of a specific creature type, similar to detect undead except the psychodermist can choose any creature type represented among the trophies he has selected for that day.<br /><br />This ability replaces aura sight.<br /><br />Residual Hatred (Su): At 8th level, a psychodermist can tap into the psychic death throes of the monsters his trophies are derived from, increasing his efficiency at slaying similar beasts. The psychodermist can spend mental focus invested in a trophy to gain the ranger&rsquo;s favored enemy class feature against the kind of creature from which the trophy was crafted. The favored enemy bonus applies against the specific creature variety, not the creature type; a psychodermist could use a red dragon scale trophy to gain favored enemy (red dragon), but not favored enemy (dragon). Each point of mental focus spent grants a cumulative +2 favored enemy bonus, with a maximum bonus equal to +2 for every 5 psychodermist levels he has. This benefit lasts until the psychodermist regains his mental focus.<br /><br />This replaces outside contact.<br /><br />Manifest Abilities (Su): At 12th level, a psychodermist can use the latent energy within his trophies to replicate his victims&rsquo; special abilities. As a standard action, he can spend 1 point of mental focus invested in a trophy to gain one of that creature&rsquo;s special abilities that could be granted by the spell monstrous physique IIIUM. At 16th level, the psychodermist adds abilities offered by monstrous physique IVUM to the options he can select using this ability. The saving throw DC for these special abilities is equal to 10 + half the psychodermist&rsquo;s level + his Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />Alternatively, he can spend 1 point of mental focus as a standard action to add any two of the creature&rsquo;s spell-like abilities to his list of spells known. To determine the spell&rsquo;s level for this ability, use the level as it appears on the spell list for an occultist, wizard, or cleric, in that order; if it appears on none of those lists, use the spell&rsquo;s highest spell level. For example, lesser restoration would be a 2nd-level spell, despite appearing on the paladin&rsquo;s 1st-level list.<br /><br />Both uses of this ability last for 1 minute per psychodermist level.

For the purpose of this ability, an object&rsquo;s secret is composed of pieces of information gained from a single object through object reading, object seer, psychometry, or read object that the occultist didn&rsquo;t otherwise know and hasn&rsquo;t shared with another, written somewhere, or otherwise recorded or found a way to recover should she forget them and lose possession of the object. The secret broker can willingly use this ability in tandem with handing the object over to another creature in order to transfer the object&rsquo;s secret to that creature. The secret broker forgets the object&rsquo;s secret and the creature instantly learns the object&rsquo;s secret.<br /><br />The secret broker can also destroy an object to remove his memory of the object&rsquo;s secret without transferring it to another.

Instead, the spells that he knows are partially determined by the type of terrain he is currently in (and the level of spells he can cast). When he leaves a type of terrain, he loses knowledge of the spells that terrain grants and instead knows the spells granted by the new type of terrain he has entered.

At 5th level, the geomancer can expend 2 points of mental focus invested in the terrain to instead increase all of his movement speeds by 20 feet. This affects only movement speeds he already has.<br /><br />This replaces aura sight.<br /><br />Dominion (Su): At 7th level, as a standard action, a geomancer can expend 1 or more points of mental focus invested in the terrain to infuse himself and each of his allies within 30 feet of him with the might of the land.

Ancestral aspirants perform all the typical social functions of a noble, but they fill their conversations with stories of the great deeds of their family forebears, and they spend their nights researching old histories and primary sources, hungry for more.<br /><br />Class Skills: An ancestral aspirant adds Bluff and Knowledge (nobility) to his list of class skills, instead of Knowledge (planes) and Profession.<br /><br />This alters the occultist&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Family Jewels: An ancestral aspirant&rsquo;s implements are always objects connected to his family history.

If he spends 1 minute examining a creature, he learns one fact, chosen by the GM, about the creature&rsquo;s current emotions. Since emotional auras are complex, this ability is unlikely to reveal the secret feelings of a professional spy; instead, it only touches upon surface emotions.<br /><br />This ability replaces object reading.<br /><br />Courtly Contacts (Su): Ancestral aspirants have contacts among courtly circles rather than otherworldly circles. This works similarly to outside contact except for the following differences: First, he doesn&rsquo;t need to use a magic circle or make a payment (though he still expends 1 point of mental focus from his enchantment implement). Second, he can use those contacts to gather information for him (as per the Diplomacy skill to gather information) without spending the time himself, rather than asking a question and receiving a result similar to a divination. He can ask more questions over the same time period at 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter, as normal with outside contact. At 16th level, instead of delivering messages and objects, the courtly contacts can spread vicious rumors and gossip about a target throughout a settlement, causing any creatures in the settlement whose attitude toward the target wasn&rsquo;t helpful to have its attitude toward the target worsened by one step. These baseless rumors last 1 week or until the target spends 8 hours refuting them and succeeds at a Diplomacy check (DC = 10 + the ancestral aspirant&rsquo;s occultist level + his Intelligence modifier).<br /><br />This ability replaces outside contact.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Occultist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-purple.jpg","_id":"rufYB25fyK7JTKkX"}

When learning new implement schools, he must choose either schools associated with his chosen panoply or the chosen panoply itself. Once he has learned to use the chosen panoply, he can learn any further implement schools freely.<br /><br />Panoply Focus (Su): At 4th level, a panoply savant gains 1 additional point of mental focus each day, which can be invested only in implements associated with his chosen panoply. At 8th level, and every 4 occultist levels thereafter, the number of additional points of mental focus he gains increases by 1 (to a maximum of 5 points at 20th level).<br /><br />This ability replaces shift focus.<br /><br />Implement Specialist (Su): At 8th level, a panoply savant learns to use his mastery over the implements in his chosen panoply to unlock greater power from magic items associated with that panoply. For a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier, when he uses a magic item that matches one of his chosen panoply&rsquo;s associated implements (crystal balls, robes, and wands for the mage&rsquo;s paraphernalia, for instance) and produces a spell effect, he can have the item use his caster level instead of its own. If the magic item doesn&rsquo;t produce a spell effect, the panoply savant can use his caster level against attempts to dispel that item. Additionally, if the item has any abilities that can be used at least three times per day or has three or more daily charges, the panoply savant can spend 1 minute quietly meditating on the item and expend 2 points of mental focus to restore one daily use or one charge to the item.<br /><br />This ability replaces outside contact.<br /><br />Panoptic Harmony (Su): At 8th level, a panoply savant can empower his abilities by harnessing the harmonic resonance between his chosen panoply&rsquo;s associated implements. Whenever he casts a spell or uses a focus power with one of his chosen panoply&rsquo;s associated implements, he treats it as though his caster level were 2 higher than it actually is, but only if on his previous turn, he cast a spell with or used a focus power from a different one of his chosen panoply&rsquo;s associated implements.<br /><br />This ability replaces magic circles.<br /><br />Panoptic Call (Su): At 12th level, a panoply savant&rsquo;s mastery over his chosen panoply&rsquo;s associated implements is so strong that he can call similar items to him. By taking a standard action and expending 1 point of mental focus from any of his chosen panoply&rsquo;s associated implements, he can cause a single item he can currently see that matches one of his chosen panoply&rsquo;s associated implements (such as a weapon or shield for the tools of the warrior) to fly through the air toward him at a rate of 30 feet per round, landing in his outstretched hand. If the item is unattended, the panoply savant automatically succeeds, but if it is held or worn, he must attempt a special disarm or stealAPG combat maneuver check, using his occultist level as his base attack bonus and his Intelligence modifier in place of his Strength modifier. If the item in question is an implement he currently has 1 or more points of focus invested in, he gains a bonus on this combat maneuver check equal to twice the amount of focus currently invested in it.<br /><br />This ability replaces binding circles.<br /><br />Combined Powers (Su): At 16th level, whenever a panoply savant uses a focus power from one of his chosen panoply&rsquo;s associated implements, he can expend 2 additional points of mental focus to also use a focus power from one of his chosen panoply&rsquo;s other associated implements as part of the same action. The second focus power must take the same amount of time or less to activate than the first focus power, and the panoply savant must expend the normal mental focus cost to use the second focus power.<br /><br />This ability replaces fast circles.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Occultist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-purple.jpg","_id":"uGvuqskkOTga8xSx"}
