This alters the samurai&rsquo;s alignment.<br /><br />Propitiation (Ex, Su, Sp): A ward speaker can perform a special ritual to propitiate kami and gain a sliver of their power. This ritual must be performed at a shrine or a location warded by a specific type of kami. The propitiation takes 1 minute and involves clapping, ringing bells, bowing, and token offerings of coins, food, incense, or other gifts. The ward speaker&rsquo;s propitiation must be performed uninterrupted to receive any benefits from it. At the end of this ritual, the ward speaker immediately gains a fortune depending on the type of kami he sought to propitiate. Common kami are presented beginning on page 159 of&nbsp;Bestiary 3, and the fortunes each of those kami grant are listed below.<br /><br />As an immediate action, the ward speaker can dismiss the fortune to reroll one d20 roll before the results of the roll are revealed; he must use the result of the second roll, even if it&rsquo;s worse. If not dismissed, a fortune remains in effect until the ward speaker regains the use of his daily abilities, at which point the fortune and its benefits end. If a ward speaker dismisses a fortune to receive a benefit based on the specific kami he propitiated (see below), he does not also gain the reroll described here.<br /><br />The ward speaker can perform this ritual once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every 3 levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level. He can maintain only one fortune at a time; performing a propitiation while he already has a fortune active ends the previous fortune and its benefits.<br /><br />This replaces resolve, greater resolve, and true resolve.<br /><br />Jinushigami (Ex, Sp): The ward speaker (and his mount, if he has one) gains a 10-foot enhancement bonus to base speed. At 9th level, this enhancement bonus increases to 20 feet. At 17th level, once per day, he can dismiss this fortune as an immediate action to cast&nbsp;earthquake&nbsp;as a spell-like ability, using his samurai level as his caster level.<br /><br />Kodama (Su): As a standard action, the ward speaker can afflict one target that can see him with a distracting gaze. If the target fails a Will save (DC = 10 + half the ward speaker&rsquo;s samurai level), it is staggered for 1d4 rounds. At 9th level, it is instead staggered for 2d4 rounds. At 17th level, it is instead staggered for 1 minute. Once a creature has been targeted by this ability, it cannot be targeted by it again for 24 hours.<br /><br />Shikigami (Ex): The ward speaker gains Catch Off-Guard and Throw Anything as bonus feats. At 9th level, he gains Toughness and Step Up. At 17th level, he gains Following Step and Step Up and Strike, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.<br /><br />Toshigami (Sp): The ward speaker can speak with plants, as the&nbsp;speak with plants&nbsp;spell. At 9th level, the ward speaker can dismiss this fortune as an immediate action to cast&nbsp;haste&nbsp;as a spell-like ability. Once per day at 17th level, the ward speaker can instead dismiss this fortune to cast&nbsp;temporal stasis&nbsp;as a spell-like ability. The ward speaker&rsquo;s caster level for these spell-like abilities is equal to his samurai level.<br /><br />Zuishin (Sp): As an immediate action, the ward speaker can dismiss this fortune to cast&nbsp;cure light wounds&nbsp;as a spell-like ability. At 9th level, the ward speaker can dismiss this fortune to cast&nbsp;cure serious wounds,&nbsp;lesser restoration,&nbsp;remove curse, or&nbsp;remove disease; at 17th level, he also adds&nbsp;breath of life&nbsp;and&nbsp;heal&nbsp;to this list. The ward speaker&rsquo;s caster level for these spell-like abilities is equal to his samurai level.<br /><br />Resilient Stand (Ex): At 11th level, the spirits can bolster a ward speaker&rsquo;s willpower and resolve, granting him an inner reservoir he can use when he needs it most. If a ward speaker has not expended his daily uses of propitiation, he can call upon the spirits to reroll a saving throw during an honorable stand instead of expending a use of resolve to do so. He must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. This expends a daily use of propitiation.<br /><br />This alters honorable stand.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Samuria","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/katana.png","_id":"J8j1vt1LxLCCOmIN"}

This style became prevalent during the peaceful and stable periods of Lung Wa, and reflected those values. Using these techniques, an ironbound sword can subdue a foe without causing permanent harm, leaving the soul of the samurai unstained by deaths of her enemies.<br /><br />Merciful Combatant (Ex): At 3rd level, an ironbound sword becomes an expert at defeating foes without killing them. An ironbound sword can use any weapon to deal nonlethal damage without taking the normal &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls. Additionally, the ironbound sword gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuvers against a target so long as the last successful attack she made against that target dealt nonlethal damage. Her samurai levels count as fighter levels and stack with fighter levels for the purposes of fighter and samurai prerequisites and class features.<br /><br />This replaces weapon expertise.<br /><br />Subduing Knockout (Ex): At 5th level, once per day, an ironbound sword can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the ironbound sword&rsquo;s attack hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the ironbound sword&rsquo;s level + the higher of the ironbound sword&rsquo;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the ironbound sword can use this ability twice per day; at 15th level, she can use it three times per day.<br /><br />This replaces banner.<br /><br />Blade Reversal (Ex): At 14th level, an ironbound sword can turn the force of an opponent&rsquo;s attacks back against them. Whenever the ironbound sword takes a full defense action, she can expend an attack of opportunity to attempt to counter melee attacks made against her. This counter is a single attack roll at the ironbound blade&rsquo;s full base attack bonus that resolves before the enemy&rsquo;s attack. If the counter successfully hits the attacking enemy&rsquo;s AC and if the ironbound sword&rsquo;s attack roll is higher than the attacking creature&rsquo;s attack roll, the ironbound sword takes no damage from the enemy&rsquo;s attack and can initiate a disarm combat maneuver against the attacking enemy as a free action. If the triggering attack was made with a natural attack or unarmed strike, a successful disarm combat maneuver renders that natural attack or unarmed strike unusable until the victim spends a standard action to reset dislocated joints. In addition, the ironbound sword can spend one use of her resolve when she hits with a nonlethal attack to initiate a disarm combat maneuver against her target as a free action.<br /><br />This replaces greater banner.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Samuria","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/katana.png","_id":"aAKdkcSOJcOquYkz"}

While these traditions first arose among the Jininese elves and are still extremely common in Jinin, the warrior poet&rsquo;s art has spread to different nations and peoples in Tian Xia over centuries.<br /><br />Dancer&rsquo;s Grace (Ex): When wearing no armor and not using a shield, the warrior poet gains a bonus to Armor Class equal to her Charisma bonus (to a maximum of her samurai level). A warrior poet loses this bonus while flatfooted or otherwise denied her Dexterity bonus.<br /><br />This replaces the samurai&rsquo;s proficiency with medium armor, heavy armor, and shields.<br /><br />Flourish (Ex): The warrior poet is skilled at performing elegant moves in battle. At 1st level, the warrior poet gains a flourish of her choice from the list below.

A warrior poet can select this flourish up to three times.<br /><br />Harmony of the Tranquil Garden: The warrior poet can focus her senses as a move action to gain blindsense out to 5 feet for 1 round. For every 5 samurai levels she has, the range of this blindsense increases by 5 feet.<br /><br />Jininsiel&rsquo;s Guidance: The warrior poet gains the rogue&rsquo;s uncanny dodge class feature. This flourish can be selected up to twice; selecting it a second time grants the warrior poet the rogue&rsquo;s improved uncanny dodge class feature.

This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

The following benefits apply only when a sword saint is using a sword and carrying nothing in his other hand. The sword saint is an archetype of the samurai alternate class (Ultimate Combat&nbsp;18).<br /><br />Iaijutsu Strike (Ex): A sword saint can perform a lightning-quick iaijutsu strike against the target of his challenge to inflict devastating wounds while drawing his sword. After the sword saint has challenged a foe but before he has attacked the target of his challenge, he may choose to use his iaijutsu strike as a full-round action, making an attack roll with his weapon as normal. In order to use this ability, the sword saint&rsquo;s weapon must be sheathed at the start of his turn. If he successfully hits his opponent with an iaijutsu strike, his attack deals an additional +1d6 points of damage. This bonus damage increases by an additional +1d6 at 3rd level and every two levels thereafter to a maximum of +10d6 damage at 19th level. Any extra damage as a result of a successful iaijutsu strike is not multiplied by a critical hit.<br /><br />After making an iaijutsu strike, a sword saint takes a &ndash;4 penalty to his AC until his next turn, but his weapon is now drawn and he may continually to fight normally. Regardless of whether he hits his opponent with the iaijutsu strike, a sword saint cannot use this ability on the same foe more than once per day.<br /><br />At 10th level, a sword saint learns to focus faster and is able to make an iaijutsu strike as a standard action, and the penalty to his AC is reduced to &ndash;2.<br /><br />This ability replaces a samurai&rsquo;s mount.<br /><br />Brutal Slash (Ex): At 3rd level, a sword saint&rsquo;s iaijutsu strike becomes even more deadly. If a sword saint threatens a critical hit with his iaijutsu strike, he adds a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level to the attack roll to confirm a critical hit. This ability replaces mounted charge.<br /><br />Terrifying Iaijutsu (Ex): At 5th level, a sword saint&rsquo;s iaijutsu strike devastates the morale of foes that witness it. When a sword saint successfully hits with an iaijutsu strike, all foes within 30 feet must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the sword saint&rsquo;s class level + the sword saint&rsquo;s Cha modifier) or become shaken for 1d4+1 rounds. This ability replaces banner.<br /><br />Roaring Iaijutsu (Ex): At 14th level, a sword saint&rsquo;s iaijutsu strike deafens foes upon impact. When a sword saint successfully hits with an iaijutsu strike, all foes within 30 feet must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the sword saint&rsquo;s class level + the sword saint&rsquo;s Str modifier) or be deafened for 1d4 minutes.
