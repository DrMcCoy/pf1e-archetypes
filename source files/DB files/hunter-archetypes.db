{"name":"Hunter (Divine Hunter)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advanced Class Guide pg. 95</a><br />While most hunters heed the call of nature and fight to protect its bounty, some are inspired to serve a higher power. These divine hunters use faith to aid them in their struggles, and their faith infuses their animal companions, making these companions champions of their deities.<br /><br />Alignment: A divine hunter&rsquo;s alignment must be within one step of her deity&rsquo;s, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis. A divine hunter can otherwise be of any alignment.<br /><br />Class Skills: A divine hunter gains Knowledge (religion) as a class skill, but she does not gain Knowledge (dungeoneering) as a class skill.<br /><br />Domain: At 3rd level, a divine hunter learns to call upon the power of her deity. The divine hunter must select one domain from those available to her deity. She gains the granted powers of this domain, using her hunter level &ndash; 2 as her cleric level for determining when the powers are gained and what effects they have. Once she chooses this domain, it cannot be changed.<br /><br />If the divine hunter selects the animal domain, she does not gain a second animal companion upon reaching an effective cleric level of 4th. When the divine hunter would gain that ability, her animal companion instead gains two ability score increases (gaining +1 to two different ability scores or +2 to one ability score). If her animal companion dies or is released, when she gains a new one, it benefits from this ability score increase.<br /><br />In addition, the divine hunter adds the 1st-level domain spell from her domain to her list of spells known. She adds the 2nd-level domain spell at 6th level, the 3rd-level domain spell at 9th level, the 4th-level domain spell at 12th level, the 5th-level domain spell at 15th level, and the 6th-level domain spell at 18th level.<br /><br />This ability replaces teamwork feats.<br /><br />Otherworldly Companion (Su): At 3rd level, a hunter&rsquo;s companion takes on otherworldly features. If the divine hunter is good (or worships a good deity), the animal companion gains the celestial template. If the hunter is evil (or worships an evil deity), the animal companion gains the fiendish template. If the hunter is neutral and worships a neutral deity, she must choose either the celestial or fiendish template; once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. The companion's CR is considered to be equal to its Hit Dice for the purpose of the celestial or fiendish template. This ability replaces hunter tactics.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Hunter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_29.jpg","_id":"1WlBjFnNeWRkp7jn"}

They still draw their inspiration and strength from the natural world, marveling at how nature flourishes wherever the city allows.<br /><br />Class Skills: An urban hunter adds Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), and Sense Motive (Wis) as class skills, and removes Knowledge (nature) (Int) and Survival (Wis). This alters the hunter&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Animal Companion (Ex): Urban hunters have animal companions that are domesticated animals or animals native to a major city. The urban hunter must select her animal companion from the following list: axe beakB3, badger, bird, camel, dire rat, dog, horse, llama (Pathfinder Player Companion: Animal Archive 28), ostrich (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Osirion, Legacy of Pharaohs 55), pony, ramB2, or trumpeter swanB4. In urban settings, an urban hunter&rsquo;s animal companion seems domesticated and likely harmless to anyone who has not seen it in combat (potentially reducing the DC of Diplomacy checks to convince anyone to allow it into secure areas). It draws no more attention than a friendly dog, loyal horse, or similar tame animal.<br /><br />Creatures who have never seen the animal companion make an attack must succeed at a Sense Motive check (opposed by the animal companion&rsquo;s Stealth check) to realize the animal companion is a potential threat. The hunter can calm those who witness her animal companion&rsquo;s attacks (so long as they were not injured) with a successful Handle Animal check (DC = 15 + the target&rsquo;s Will save modifier).<br /><br />Captor (Ex): At 3rd level, an urban hunter and her animal companion take no penalties when dealing nonlethal damage with weapons or natural attacks. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the urban hunter selects a bonus feat from the following list to be gained by both the hunter and her animal companion: Improved Bull Rush, Improved Dirty TrickAPG, Improved Disarm, Improved Grapple, and Improved Trip. At 12th level, the hunter can also select from the following feats: Combat Patrol, Combat Reflexes, Disarming StrikeAPG, Greater Bull Rush, Greater Dirty TrickAPG, Greater Disarm, Greater Grapple, Greater Trip, and Lunge. Neither the hunter nor her animal companion needs to meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces hunter tactics and teamwork feat.<br /><br />Animal Insight (Ex): At 5th level, an urban hunter and her animal companion learn to combine their insights to defeat deception and manipulation. As long as they are within 30 feet of each other, both hunter and animal companion gain an insight bonus on Sense Motive checks equal to half the urban hunter&rsquo;s hunter level. They also gain a +2 insight bonus on Will saving throws against illusions and mindaffecting effects. This ability replaces woodland stride.<br /><br />Frightful Ferocity (Ex): At 17th level, an urban hunter and her animal companion can each attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize a foe as a swift action. This ability replaces one with the wild.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Hunter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_29.jpg","_id":"2vyHRB1iZfGndZr1"}

She adds the following choices to her animal focus ability instead of the bear, frog, monkey, mouse, and snake choices.<br /><br />Crow: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Knowledge checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.

While most foresters feel strong bonds with woodland regions, the archetype functions well in other terrains as well. In such cases, a forester might refer to herself by a different name that more accurately reflects her chosen terrain. For example, a forester who favors bogs and marshes might call herself a &ldquo;swamper,&rdquo; while one who favors frozen regions might call herself a &ldquo;glacier guardian.&rdquo; As foresters gain levels and take on new favored terrains, they often eschew such titles completely, viewing them as unnecessary, and merely refer to themselves as guardians of the wild or champions of nature&rsquo;s will&mdash;but regardless of the name, their devotion remains.<br /><br />Animal Focus (Su): As a forester has no animal companion, the aspects granted by this ability always apply to the forester herself, just as if a normal hunter&rsquo;s companion were dead.<br /><br />This alters animal focus.<br /><br />Favored Terrain (Ex): A forester gains the ranger&rsquo;s favored terrain ability. She gains her first favored terrain at 5th level and a new favored terrain every 4 levels thereafter. In addition, at each such interval, the bonuses on initiative checks and skill checks in one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired) increase by 2. Starting at 5th level, a forester adds half her favored terrain bonus on damage rolls while in her favored terrain and fighting a creature native to that terrain.<br /><br />This replaces animal companion.<br /><br />Bonus Feat (Ex): At 2nd level, a forester gains one bonus combat feat. She must meet the prerequisites for this feat as normal. She gains an additional bonus combat feat at 7th, 13th, and 19th levels.<br /><br />This replaces precise companion.<br /><br />Tactician (Ex): At 3rd level as a standard action, a forester can grant the benefits of one teamwork feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her.

{"name":"Hunter (Packmaster)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advanced Class Guide pg. 96</a><br />Some hunters form bonds with packs of well-trained creatures. Whether such a hunter is a northern berserker running with a pack of timber wolves or a savage warrior dashing through the jungle alongside her herd of dimetrodons, the packmaster revels in the thrill of the hunt and the glory of the kill. A packmaster is more comfortable in groups than alone, and although her animal companions may be weaker than a typical hunter&rsquo;s, what they lack in strength they make up for in numbers.<br /><br />Pack Bond (Ex): A packmaster can have more than one animal companion, but she must divide her effective druid level between her companions to determine the abilities of each one. For example, a 4th-level packmaster can have one 4th-level animal companion, two 2nd-level companions, one 3rd-level companion and one 1st-level companion, or four 1st-level companions.<br /><br />When a packmaster gains a level, she must decide how to allocate the increase among her animal companions, including whether or not to add a new 1st-level companion. Once a hunter level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the packmaster&rsquo;s service. She must release the companion or wait until the companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion, which she can then do the next time she refreshes her spell slots for the day. The share spells animal companion ability applies to only one animal companion at a time&mdash;the packmaster cannot use it to cast a spell that affects only a single target and have the spell affect all of her animal companions.<br /><br />A packmaster&rsquo;s precise companion, woodland stride, and teamwork feats apply to only one of her animal companions at a time. (For example, a packmaster can apply precise companion to one companion, woodland stride to another, and a given teamwork feat to a third, but cannot apply any of those to two animal companions at once.) As a swift action, she can change which companion gains any or all of these benefits. This ability replaces animal companion.<br /><br />Pack Focus (Su): This ability functions like animal focus, with the following exceptions. A packmaster can apply her animal aspect to only one of her animal companions at a time without it counting against the number of minutes per day she can use that ability. When using animal focus on herself or her other animal companion, the ability counts against her minutes per day as normal. She can have only two animal aspects in effect at a time&mdash;one that counts against her minutes per day and one that doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;and they can&rsquo;t both target the same companion. Unless both her companions are dead, the hunter can&rsquo;t apply the companion&rsquo;s aspect to herself (and thereby gain the benefit of its unlimited duration). This ability replaces animal focus.<br /><br />Teamwork Feat (Ex): At 3rd level or any level at which a packmaster would gain a bonus teamwork feat, she can instead increase the number of her animal companions that gain the benefits of her precise companion, woodland stride, and teamwork feats by 1. She can select this ability multiple times. This ability alters teamwork feats.<br /><br />Second Pack Focus (Su): At 8th level, the hunter gains an ability that functions like the second animal focus, but the hunter can either assign each companion one aspect each or assign both aspects to the same companion. The foci on the companions don&rsquo;t need to be the same, nor do they need to be the same as the one assigned to the packmaster. This ability replaces second animal focus.<br /><br />Master of the Pack (Ex): At 20th level, a packmaster and her animal companions can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.

A Free Captain ordering her crew to occupy foes and thus expose the enemy to her attacks might take this archetype, and colluding scoundrels have proven to be formidable members of the Wasp Queens, as their giant wasp companions draw out opponents to fall under the Wasp Queens&rsquo; stinging blades. In any case, the colluding scoundrel rarely concerns herself overmuch with her allies&rsquo; well-being.<br /><br />Scapegoat (Ex): A colluding scoundrel is adept at redirecting a foe&rsquo;s hostility toward another creature, creating openings for her own attacks. A number of times per day equal to her hunter level, as a swift action, she can target one foe within 30 feet and designate one willing ally adjacent to that foe as a scapegoat. For the following minute, the target takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attacks against any creature other than the designated scapegoat, and the target has a 10% spell failure chance on spells that don&rsquo;t target the scapegoat or include the scapegoat in their area of effect.

This increases to 3d6 points of damage at 15th level. This is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit, but it does stack with sneak attack and similar effects.<br /><br />This replaces second animal focus.<br /><br />Master Backstabber (Ex): At 20th level, a colluding scoundrel is a master at dispatching distracted targets. As a standard action, she can make a single attack against a foe that is taking the penalties of her scapegoat ability and is adjacent to an ally currently designated as the scapegoat. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the colluding scoundrel&rsquo;s level + her Wisdom modifier) or be slain.

These fearsome and wondrous animals have made their way into Kellid culture and tradition. Tribes are named after these creatures. Armor, clothing, weapons, and jewelry&mdash;when not fashioned from bone, hide, or teeth harvested from these beasts&mdash;are worked into images that evoke their shape and strength. They are even captured and trained for use as guardians, as hunters, or in the most iconic use, as mounts&mdash;though they&rsquo;re rarely tamed, as the Mammoth Lords value the ferociousness of these creatures. The sight of a Mammoth Lord atop an elephantine steed is one that few soon forget.<br /><br />For some of the people of the Mammoth Lords, this adoration and respect for the megafauna that share their realm goes one step further. ShamansACG, oraclesAPG, druids, and others worship these animals as primal spirits of the world and draw great power from their faith. Others, like rangers and barbarians, are no less faithful in their belief, even though they focus more on physical combat than on spellcasting. Among the most devoted of these hunters are the so-called totem-bonded&mdash;hunters who are able to form a true spiritual bond with the powerful fauna that dominate the wildlands. Such a hunter embraces one of the realm&rsquo;s megafauna as a sort of spiritual guide, eventually attracting a mighty beast that travels with her and helps keep her territory free of invaders. By doing so, the totem-bonded hunter becomes something more than merely a guardian and provider for her tribe&mdash;she becomes a manifestation of the tribe&rsquo;s spiritual belief in the power of the land itself.<br /><br />Primeval Companion (Ex): The totem-bonded adopts a powerful animal native to the region&mdash;often one suited to the cold tundra&mdash;selected from the following list: aurochs, badgerB2, bear, big cat, elkB3, giant ravenB6, mastodon, rhinoceros, walrusB4, wolf, or any creature categorized as megafauna. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, she can select other animal companions.<br /><br />In addition, a 7th-level totem-bonded&rsquo;s animal companion can grow further. If the animal companion&rsquo;s natural size is Large but it is normally available as a Medium animal companion at 7th level (such as a bear), the totembonded can have the companion increase in size. To generate statistics for such a creature, apply the following modifications: Size Large; AC +1 natural armor; Ability Scores Str +4, Dex &ndash;2, Con +2. Increase the damage of each of the companion&rsquo;s natural attacks by one die size.<br /><br />This ability alters animal companion.<br /><br />Shared Strength (Su): At 1st level, the connection the totem-bonded has with her animal companion allows them to draw upon one another&rsquo;s strength. The totem-bonded can activate this ability as a swift action, and she can use it for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The effect ends immediately if the animal companion is ever more than 100 feet away from the totem-bonded.<br /><br />While the shared strength ability is active, the totembonded manifests one aspect of her animal companion drawn from the following list: low-light vision, scent, +1 bonus to natural armor, +10-foot bonus to speed, climb speed 30 feet, swim speed 40 feet, 2 claws (1d4), bite (1d6), gore (1d6), or slam (1d6); the natural attacks are all primary attacks, and the listed damage is for a Medium creature. The totem-bonded can select only a movement speed or natural attack that her animal companion also has, and an aspect cannot cause her speed or size to exceed that of her animal companion with this ability. At 8th level, the totem-bonded manifests two aspects of her animal companion, and she adds the following to her list of available aspects: +20-foot bonus to speed, fly speed 50 feet (average), increased size (as enlarge person), and powerful charge (doubles the damage dice dealt by the granted gore or slam attack). At 15th level, the damage dealt by any natural attacks granted by this ability increases by two die steps.<br /><br />A totem-bonded&rsquo;s animal companion also benefits from the shared strength ability, and while it is active, the animal understands the totem-bonded&rsquo;s known languages and can be pushed to perform an unfamiliar trick as a free action. At 8th level, the animal companion gains a +1 bonus on saving throws and a +2 bonus on checks with each skill in which it has at least 1 rank. At 15th level, the animal companion&rsquo;s bonuses on saving throws and skill checks increase to +2 and +4 respectively.<br /><br />This ability replaces the hunter&rsquo;s animal focus class feature.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Hunter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_29.jpg","_id":"fwJPeSSRCRiyV4Q7"}

This functions as alter self, except it is used on an adjacent animal companion to have it assume a humanoid form. The companion always assumes the same form, selected when the hunter reaches 3rd level. The hunter can change this form when she gains a new level, but the companion loses the old form and can&rsquo;t resume it unless the chameleon adept chooses that form when she reaches a new level. The companion is no more intelligent or less savage than normal; the hunter still needs to control it as normal, and it still can&rsquo;t activate magic items or wield manufactured weapons.

This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level.<br /><br />This replaces precise companion.<br /><br />Animal Shape (Su): At 5th level as a standard action, a chameleon adept can assume a form superficially identical to her animal companion&rsquo;s animal form.

They and their animal companions are more refined than typical hunters, using their skills to navigate the winding paths of courtly intrigue as surely as other hunters find trails in the wilderness.<br /><br />Class Skills: A courtly hunter adds Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive to her list of class skills, instead of Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), and Survival.<br /><br />This alters the hunter&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Courtly Companion: A courtly hunter&rsquo;s animal companion was touched by either the fey or the nature spirits that form leshys and answer to commune with nature, granting it its own intelligence. The companion&rsquo;s type changes to magical beast (augmented animal), but this doesn&rsquo;t change any of its statistics and it counts as an animal, not as a magical beast, for the purposes of determining all effects, prerequisites, and so on. It does not learn tricks, but it does have an Intelligence score equal to that of a familiar belonging to a wizard of the courtly hunter&rsquo;s hunter level. Levels in other classes that grant animal companions do not stack with levels of courtly hunter for the purpose of determining the abilities of her courtly companion.<br /><br />This ability alters animal companion.<br /><br />Refined Focus (Su): A courtly hunter has access to a different set of animal aspects with her animal focus. She does not gain access to the bear, bull, frog, monkey, snake, stag, tiger, or wolf aspects. Instead, she gains access to the following aspects.<br /><br />Beaver: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Craft checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.<br /><br />Chameleon: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Disguise checks.

This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.<br /><br />This ability alters animal focus.<br /><br />Subtle Companion (Su): At 2nd level, a courtly hunter can transform her animal companion into a similar Tiny animal to allow it hide easily or even blend in and act as a spy. For instance, a tiger could be transformed into a housecat, a wolf could be transformed into a Tiny dog, a dire bat could be transformed into a Tiny flying fox, and so on. This functions as a polymorph effect, and the animal companion gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity and a &ndash;4 size penalty to Strength (use the polymorph table on page 212 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook to adjust its ability score if the animal companion is larger than Medium). As a standard action, the courtly hunter can touch her animal companion to transform it.<br /><br />This ability replaces precise companion.<br /><br />Skill Bond (Ex): At 3rd level, a courtly hunter&rsquo;s animal companion gains the courtly hunter&rsquo;s class skills as class skills. Her animal companion can use the courtly hunter&rsquo;s skill ranks in a skill in place of its own, but only to a maximum of the courtly hunter&rsquo;s hunter level (for instance, if a character had 3 levels in courtly hunter and 5 ranks in Diplomacy, her animal companion could either share 3 ranks with skill bond or use its own ranks, whichever would result in a higher total skill bonus).<br /><br />This ability replaces hunter tactics and the hunter&rsquo;s bonus teamwork feats.<br /><br />Alternate Form (Su): At 7th level, the courtly hunter&rsquo;s animal companion learns an additional subtle form. When the courtly hunter gains this ability, she chooses a Tiny animal. When under the effects of the subtle companion ability, the courtly hunter&rsquo;s animal companion can change between a shrunken, more innocuous version of its original shape or the shape of the chosen animal as a standard action. When it transforms, it loses abilities dependent on its original shape and gains abilities from its new shape as beast shape II.

A patient ambusher can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.<br /><br />This replaces nature training and wild empathy.<br /><br />Snare Trap (Ex or Su): At 3rd level, a patient ambusher learns how to create a snare trap. The patient ambusher can use this and other learned traps a total number of times per day equal to half her hunter level + her Wisdom modifier. This snare trap otherwise functions the same as the ranger snare trap detailed in Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic.<br /><br />This replaces the hunter tactics class feature.<br /><br />Additional Traps (Ex or Su): At 3rd level and every 3 hunter levels thereafter, a patient ambusher can learn a new type of trap, selected from the list of ranger traps presented on pages 64&ndash;65 of Ultimate Magic.

Attaching the trap to the projectile is part of the full-round action to create a new trap. The trapped projectile is fired or thrown in the normal manner. If fired at a square, the trap is treated as if the hunter had set the trap in that square, except the DC is 5 lower than normal. If the trap is fired at a creature, the target takes damage from the ranged weapon and is treated as if it had triggered the trap (attempting a saving throw, if any). The attack has a maximum range of 60 feet, and penalties from range increments apply on the attack roll.

These hunters form potent bonds with plant creatures, and their leafy or fungal friends are more than capable of anything another hunter&rsquo;s animal allies can accomplish.<br /><br />Plant Companion (Ex): A plant master forms a mystic bond with a plant companion. A plant master can begin play with any plant companion (see page 182 and page 26 of the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide). Except for the companion being a creature of the plant type, this ability otherwise works like the druid&rsquo;s animal companion.<br /><br />This replaces animal companion.<br /><br />Plant Focus (Su): A plant master can take on the aspect of a plant as a swift action. He must select one type of plant to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of plant emulated and his hunter level. The plant master can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his level. This duration does not need to be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. He can emulate only one plant at a time.<br /><br />The plant master can also apply one of these aspects to his plant companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&rsquo;s minutes of duration per day&mdash;it remains in effect until he changes it. The companion&rsquo;s aspect can be the same aspect the hunter has taken on or a different one. A plant master can select or change the plant foci on both himself and his plant companion as part of the same swift action.<br /><br />Assassin Vine: The creature gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple. This bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and +4 at 15th level.<br /><br />Brambles: When the creature is hit by an unarmed strike or natural attack, the attacker takes 1 point of piercing damage.

This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.<br /><br />Shrieker: The creature gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. At 8th level, the range increases by 30 feet. At 15th level, the creature also gains blindsense with a range of 10 feet.<br /><br />Spore: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Fly checks.

This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.<br /><br />This replaces animal focus.<br /><br />Green Empathy (Ex): A plant master can improve the attitude of a plant creature. Green empathy functions like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The plant master rolls 1d20 and adds his hunter level and his Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical wild plant creature has a starting attitude of indifferent. To use green empathy, the plant master and the plant creature must be within 30 feet of each other under normal conditions. Generally, influencing a plant creature in this way takes 1 minute, but as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.<br /><br />A plant master can also use this ability to influence an animal, but he takes a &ndash;4 penalty on the check. He has no ability to influence magical beasts.<br /><br />This replaces the wild empathy class feature.<br /><br />Plant Shield (Ex): At 17th level, a plant master and his companion are distasteful to plant creatures.

Though she lacks an animal companion, a feral hunter is in tune with the beast lurking within her flesh and spirit, and lives in a near-wild state of being. A feral hunter often resembles a lycanthrope, but her power comes from her own nature and is not inf luenced by moonlight or silver.<br /><br />Solitary: Unlike most hunters, a feral hunter does not gain an animal companion.<br /><br />Feral Focus (Su): At 1st level, a feral hunter gains a limited ability to change her shape into hybrid animal forms. This functions as the animal focus class feature, except that the hunter always applies the animal aspect to herself, and there is no limit to this ability&rsquo;s duration. She can end this ability as a free action.<br /><br />When a feral hunter uses this ability, her body takes on cosmetic aspects of an animal, such as furry skin, longer nails, elongated teeth, and oddly colored eyes; these changes do not grant her any abilities other than what is stated in the animal focus, and end when she takes on a different aspect or ends the ability. This physical change is a polymorph effect, though the effects of the animal focus are not.<br /><br />This ability alters animal focus and replaces the hunter tactics and speak with master class abilities.<br /><br />Precise Summoned Animal (Ex): This functions like the precise companion class ability, except the hunter grants all her teamwork feats to all animals she summons with summon nature&rsquo;s ally. This ability alters precise companion.<br /><br />Wild Shape (Su): At 4th level, a feral hunter gains the ability to change shape. This ability functions like the druid wild shape ability, except the hunter can take only animal forms (not elemental or plant forms). The hunter&rsquo;s effective druid level is equal to her class level. This ability replaces the bonus tricks, improved empathic link, greater empathic link, master of the wild, and raise animal companion class abilities.<br /><br />Summon Pack (Sp): Starting at 6th level, whenever a feral hunter casts a summon nature&rsquo;s ally spell to summon one or more animals, she summons one additional animal of the same type. The summoned creature or creatures must be animals and must be of the same type as the hunter&rsquo;s current aspect or of a similar type (bears for bear aspect, dogs or wolves for wolf aspect, great cats for the tiger aspect, and so on). The additional creature immediately vanishes if the hunter chooses a different aspect or ends his feral focus ability. She can increase the duration of any one summon nature's ally spell affected by this ability to 1 minute per level. She can have only one spell with a duration increased by this ability active at a time.

This functions as animal focus, but allows only the following choices.<br /><br />Ant: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.<br /><br />Beetle: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its natural armor bonus. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level. (A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.)<br /><br />Centipede: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on Climb checks and a +2 bonus to CMD against pull, push, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers. These bonuses increase to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.<br /><br />Cockroach: The creature gains a +4 bonus on saves against cold dangers, disease, heat dangers, starvation, thirst, and on Constitution checks to avoid suffocation. These bonuses increase to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.<br /><br />Crab: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks and a +2 competence bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks. These bonuses increase to +6 and +4 respectively at 8th level, and +8 and +6 at 15th level.<br /><br />Flea: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on saves against disease and Acrobatics checks to jump. These bonuses increase to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.<br /><br />Fly: The creature gains a +2 bonus on Perception checks and on Acrobatics checks to balance or fall safely. These bonuses increase to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.<br /><br />Leech: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks, and deals 1 point of bleed damage every time it succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver check to damage an opponent. These benefits increase to a +4 bonus and 3 points of bleed at 8th level, and a +6 bonus and 5 points of bleed at 15th level. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with itself.<br /><br />Mantis: The creature gains a +2 bonus on attack of opportunity attack rolls and a +2 competence bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks. These bonuses increase to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.<br /><br />Moth: The creature gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet. At 8th level, the range increases by 30 feet. At 15th level, the creature gains blindsense to a range of 10 feet.<br /><br />Phasmid: The creature gains low-light vision and a +4 competence bonus on Stealth checks in forests or plains. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.<br /><br />Scorpion: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on Stealth checks and grapple combat maneuver checks. These bonuses increase to +6 and +4 respectively at 8th level, and +8 and +6 at 15th level.<br /><br />Spider: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on Stealth checks, saving throws against web effects (magical or otherwise), and checks to break free of webs. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.<br /><br />Wasp: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Perception checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.<br /><br />Worm: The creature gains a 25% chance to treat any critical hit or sneak attack as a normal hit (as the fortification armor special ability). This increases to 50% at 8th level, and 75% at 15th level.<br /><br />This ability replaces animal focus.<br /><br />Swarm Stride (Ex): At 5th level, a verminous hunter learns to move through vermin without danger. He can safely pass through swarms of vermin and does not take swarm damage while within a vermin swarm&rsquo;s space. In addition, he is immune to a swarm&rsquo;s distraction ability. If the hunter or his animal companion attacks a swarm, they lose this protection against only that swarm. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Hunter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_29.jpg","_id":"zqufjHM6NQcJgGaS"}
