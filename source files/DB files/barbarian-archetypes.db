The raging cannibal is a barbarian who feasts upon her fallen opponents not out of hunger, or even a taste for flesh, but rather because she believes consuming her foes and defiling their lost lives demonstrates her strength. This penchant for feasting on the flesh of her kin makes the raging cannibal an awkward companion to travel with for many groups, with rumors revolving around the raging cannibal&rsquo;s culinary exploits often causing tense situations that other party members might be called upon to resolve via diplomacy before the raging cannibal grows frustrated and decides to take matters into her own hands!<br /><br />Animal Fury: At 2nd level, a raging cannibal must select animal fury as her first rage power.<br /><br />This alters the barbarian&rsquo;s 2nd-level rage power.<br /><br />Consume Vigor (Ex): At 2nd level, when a raging cannibal reduces a creature of the same creature type as herself to 0 or fewer hit points with her bite attack during combat while raging, she can consume a chunk of its body to gain a portion of its power. If the creature&rsquo;s CR equals or exceeds her barbarian level, the raging cannibal gains 1 additional round of rage. She can never consume the same creature&rsquo;s vigor more than once. At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the raging cannibal gains 1 additional round of rage each time she uses this ability.<br /><br />This replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Intimidating Gouge (Ex): At 3rd level, when a raging cannibal confirms a critical hit against a creature of the same creature type as herself with her bite attack while raging, she gains a bonus on Intimidate checks equal to half her barbarian level for the duration of the rage.<br /><br />This replaces trap sense.<br /><br />Feed from Fury (Ex): At 5th level, a raging cannibal is empowered by eating her enemies during combat. When a raging cannibal confirms a critical hit against a creature of the same creature type as herself with her bite attack while raging, she gains a number of temporary hit points equal to her barbarian level. These temporary hit points stack with other temporary hit points gained from this ability but not with those from other sources. These temporary hit points fade after a period of time equal to 10 minutes per barbarian level.<br /><br />This replaces improved uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Razor-Toothed Fury (Ex): At 6th level, a raging cannibal&rsquo;s bite becomes even more fearsome. When using her bite attack, the raging cannibal can take a &ndash;1 penalty on her attack roll to add 2 points of bleed damage to the damage dealt. At 10th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the attack penalty increases by 1 and the bleed damage increases by 2 points.<br /><br />This replaces damage reduction.<br /><br />Rage Powers: The following rage powers complement the raging cannibal archetype: internal fortitude, intimidating glare, primal scent, scent, and terrifying howl.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Barbarian","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/greataxe.png"}

The prejudice and misunderstanding with which civilized folk often regard barbarians is often even more pronounced in the case of these belligerent outcasts from society, in large part due to the fact that brutish swampers deliberately mock and antagonize the so-called &ldquo;city folk.&rdquo; To a brutish swamper, an urban lifestyle is one that breeds weakness and lassitude in the body. The brutish swamper has little interest or patience in maintaining alliances or friendship with those who live such soft lifestyles, and this aggression only further encourages feelings of prejudice on both sides of the cultural divide. When a brutish swamper joins an adventuring party, they usually come to value the skills and talents of their more urbanized companions, but never fully understand the desire to live lives surrounded by creature comforts.<br /><br />Swamp Skills: A brutish swamper adds Knowledge (geography) and Knowledge (local) to her list of class skills.<br /><br />This alters the barbarian&rsquo;s skills.<br /><br />Marsh March (Ex): A brutish swamper can move through the underbrush and muddy terrain of bogs and swamps at her normal speed without taking damage or suffering other impairments.

A few who survive the experience begin to embrace the adrenaline and surge of joy that comes from dancing along the edge of a whirling firestorm. These thrill-seekers are known as burn riders, and their exploits are celebrated by all Shoanti. Burn riders learn early on that speed and lightning-quick reactions are essential to avoid becoming trapped by the fickle whims of a raging emberstorm. They have an uncanny understanding of fire and can read the currents in the smoke.<br /><br />Flame Runner (Ex): At 1st level, once per rage, a burn rider can goad her mount into a burst of incredible speed. The mount&rsquo;s speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the burn rider&rsquo;s turn. This bonus to speed increases by 10 feet at 9th level and again at 15th level.

If the burn rider ends this movement outside the area of effect, she takes no damage from the effect. After this sudden movement, the burn rider is staggered until the end of her next turn. If the burn rider is mounted, her mount makes the movement instead, and both the mount and the burn rider are staggered until the end of the burn rider&rsquo;s next turn.

In addition, a sea reaver can move normally though squares of standing water or bog that is 1 foot deep. It does not cost her extra movement to traverse these terrains. Lastly, a sea reaver ignores the normal cover bonus to AC when attacking creatures that are partially immersed in water.

Since the cataclysmic Rain of Stars millennia ago, these warriors have developed numerous techniques and skills to protect themselves from the strange mechanical monsters that roam Numeria. While many native Kellids oppose the Technic League and its espousal of foul alien artifacts, the most stalwart and staunchly dedicated of these technophobic traditionalists refer to themselves as Numerian liberators.<br /><br />Class Skill: A Numerian liberator gains Stealth as a class skill and removes Climb from her list of barbarian class skills.<br /><br />Hard Hitter (Ex): At 2nd level, a Numerian liberator can make devastating attacks against objects and foes with breakable components.

This ability replaces fast movement.<br /><br />Jotungrip (Ex): At 2nd level, a titan mauler may choose to wield a two-handed melee weapon in one hand with a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. The weapon must be appropriately sized for her, and it is treated as one-handed when determining the effect of Power Attack, Strength bonus to damage, and the like. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Massive Weapons (Ex): At 3rd level, a titan mauler becomes skilled in the use of massive weapons looted from her titanic foes. She can use two-handed weapons meant for creatures one size category larger, but the penalty for doing so is increased by 4.

The spirits&rsquo; aid enables them to overcome the distractions of the flesh&mdash; they can ignore pain, and even defy death. These ascetics make up much of the Rivethun martial forces.<br /><br />Contemplative (Ex): A geminate invoker adds Knowledge (history), Knowledge (religion), and Linguistics to his list of class skills. Unlike most barbarians, a geminate invoker can be lawful, but must maintain a neutral element to his alignment. A geminate invoker who ceases to be neutral-aligned cannot activate his trance ability.<br /><br />This alters the barbarian&rsquo;s class skills and alignment.<br /><br />Trance (Ex): As a free action, a geminate invoker can enter a self-imposed trance, ignoring the physical limits of his body. This ability functions similarly to a barbarian&rsquo;s rage, except where noted below, and feats, spells, and abilities that affect a barbarian&rsquo;s rage (such as the Extra Rage feat) apply to an geminate invoker&rsquo;s trance. A geminate invoker gains rage powers as per a normal barbarian, but he can never gain totem rage powers via this ability.<br /><br />Instead of the normal rage bonuses and penalties, a geminate invoker in a trance gains a +4 morale bonus to his Constitution; gains a +2 morale bonus on Reflex and Will saving throws; takes no penalties to AC; can still use Dexterity-, Intelligence-, and Charisma-based skills; and gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Diehard\">Diehard</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. The Constitution bonus increases to +6 and the save bonus increases to +3 when he gains greater rage, and they increase to a +8 Constitution bonus and a +4 bonus on saves when he gains mighty rage.<br /><br />This ability alters rage.<br /><br />Haunt Channeler (Su): At 3rd level, a geminate invoker gains the power to sense and absorb lingering spiritual energy. This functions identically to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Medium\">medium class ability of the same name</a>, except the geminate invoker deals 1d6 points of damage to haunts for every 3 barbarian levels he has.<br /><br />This ability replaces trap sense.<br /><br />Spirit Conduit (Su): At 4th level, a geminate invoker can invite a spirit into his body each time he enters a trance, gaining a lesser totem rage power for the duration of his trance. He can select a new totem each time he enters his trance, though the GM might rule that certain totem spirits are simply not available in certain locations (such as channeling a celestial totem in an evil god&rsquo;s temple). Invoking a totem counter to his alignment (such as a neutral good character invoking a fiend totem) requires the geminate invoker to succeed at a DC 12 Charisma check each round to dominate the spirit. Failure indicates the spirit escapes, immediately ending the trance. At 8th level, the geminate invoker gains a second totem rage power, though it must use the previously granted lesser totem rage power as a prerequisite. At 12th level, he also gains the greater totem rage power that uses the previously granted powers as prerequisites.<br /><br />This ability replaces the rage powers gained at 4th, 8th, and 12th levels</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Barbarian","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/greataxe.png"}

This ability replaces fast movement.<br /><br />Tolerance (Ex): At 2nd level, a scarred rager who fails a save against an effect that causes her to become nauseated, sickened, fatigued, or exhausted can make a second save to negate the effect on the start of her next turn. Only one additional save is allowed. If the effect does not allow a saving throw, its duration is halved instead (minimum of 1 round).

These barbarians are a danger not only to their foes, but also to the very environment around them.

These barbarians often utilize pieced-together armor and fight with their sharp teeth and whatever improvised weapons are within reach. A feral gnasher has the following class features.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A feral gnasher loses all martial weapon proficiencies except for greatclub and loses proficiency with medium armor.<br /><br />Savage Bite (Ex): At 1st level, a feral gnasher gains a savage bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of damage. If the goblin already has the hard head, big teeth racial trait, the damage increases to 1d6. At 10th level, the damage from a feral gnasher&rsquo;s bite increases to 1d6 (or 1d8 if the goblin has the hard head, big teeth racial trait) and deals &times;3 damage on a critical hit.

This ability replaces trap sense +2.<br /><br />Greater Lockjaw (Ex): At 9th level and again at 15th level, the size of a creature a feral gnasher is able to use her lockjaw&rsquo;s grab ability on increases by one size increment. This ability replaces trap sense +3 and trap sense +5.<br /><br />Wicked Improvisation (Ex): At 12th level, a feral gnasher becomes more capable with improvised weapons and natural attacks. The feral gnasher gains a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls when using natural attacks or improvised weapons while raging. At 14th level and every two levels thereafter, the damage bonus increases by +1. This increase is not precision damage and is thus multiplied on a critical hit.

In this terrain, she also increases the miss chance caused by concealment for attacks against her by 5%. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Jungle Endurance (Ex): At 3rd level, a jungle rager gains a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist the effects of hot weather and diseases.

They learn the giants&rsquo; speech and culture; they study their traditions and brutality; and most importantly, they foster their hatred of these oversized foes.<br /><br />When Mammoth Lord followings travel, giant stalkers scout ahead, securing safe passage through giant-infested territories. They clear giant hunting parties and ambushes, using gruesome trophies to mark the trails. Sometimes giant hunters send their own raiding parties into the mountains to capture young giants, as most followings keep giant thralls as symbols of status.<br /><br />Harangue Giant (Ex): While raging, a giant stalker can speak Giant. If the giant stalker already knows Giant, she gains a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks when speaking Giant while raging.<br /><br />This ability alters rage.<br /><br />Smell Giants (Ex): A 2nd level, a giant stalker gains the scent special ability, but with regard only to humanoids with the giant subtype.<br /><br />This ability replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Giant Baiter (Su): At 3rd level, a raging giant stalker can take a move action to erupt into a violent or vulgar display directed at a single giant within 60 feet. This display is infused with secret magical traditions that draw upon the Mammoth Lords&rsquo; ancestral enmities toward giants. A targeted giant must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the giant stalker&rsquo;s barbarian level + the giant stalker&rsquo;s Constitution modifier) or be compelled to focus its attacks on the giant stalker; this ability can also affect non-giant creatures that are Large or larger, though such creatures gain a +4 bonus on the Will save to resist the effect. This compulsion ends if the giant stalker is out of sight or inaccessible to the giant&rsquo;s attacks. While baited, a giant is distracted and enraged by the insults&mdash;a giant stalker gains a +1 dodge bonus to her AC against any giant she has successfully baited. Once baited, a giant remains baited for a number of rounds equal to the giant stalker&rsquo;s Constitution modifier, or until the giant stalker&rsquo;s rage ends (whichever comes first). If the giant stalker baits a different giant, any previously baited giant is no longer baited. A giant that successfully saves against baiting is immune to that giant stalker&rsquo;s giant baiter ability for 24 hours. This is a language-dependent mind affecting effect.<br /><br />At 6th level, a giant stalker can bait two giants at once, and her AC bonus against baited giants increases to +2. At 9th level, baiting giants becomes a swift action, and her AC bonus against baited giants increases to +3. At 12th level, she can bait up to three giants at once, and her AC bonus against baited giants increases to +4. At 15th level, baiting giants becomes a free action, and her AC bonus against baited giants increases to +5. At 18th level, a giant stalker can bait a number of giants equal to 3 + her Constitution modifier, and her AC bonus against baited giants increases to +6.<br /><br />This ability replaces trap sense.<br /><br />Giant Stalker Rage Powers: A giant stalker gains access to the following rage powers.<br /><br />Giant Stalker Defense (Ex): When raging, a giant stalker does not take a penalty to Armor Class against attacks from giants.<br /><br />Topple Giant (Ex): When raging, the giant stalker does not provoke attacks of opportunity when she attempts to trip a giant, and can attempt to trip a giant that is up to two size categories larger than she is.<br /><br />Underfoot (Ex): When raging, the giant stalker can attempt to enter a giant&rsquo;s space, provided she is at least one size category smaller than the giant. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Doing so takes a move action and requires a successful combat maneuver check against the giant&rsquo;s CMD. If she succeeds, she enters a square in the giant&rsquo;s space. If she makes an attack against the giant while sharing its space, the giant is treated as being flat-footed against her. At the end of her turn, she exits the giant&rsquo;s space into any square adjacent to the giant&rsquo;s space.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Barbarian","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/greataxe.png"}

The typical cave dweller is perfectly content to live his entire life underground, and he may even view the light of the sun as particularly abhorrent or taboo. While this lifestyle doesn&rsquo;t in and of itself imply evil or sinister intent, many outlanders ignorantly assume that cave dwellers avoid the light of the sun for malicious reasons. In truth, cave dwellers are as capable of goodness and kindness as any other&mdash;they just see little reason to venture out of their preferred homelands. When a cave dweller joins an adventuring party, she may retain an inherent nervousness about sleeping under the open sky and may long for the familiar confines of a comforting cavern, but this rarely translates directly into a notable disadvantage. Indeed, many adventuring groups come to value the specialized talents and skills the cave dweller brings to the party.<br /><br />Skills: A cave dweller gains Stealth as a class skill in place of Ride.<br /><br />This alters the barbarian&rsquo;s skills.<br /><br />Tight Tunnels (Ex): Cave dwellers pursue prey through the winding tunnels of the deep, which rarely accommodate open sprints.

While some hide their shame, others foster a deep, burning hatred that they channel into a raw fury and unleash against their enemies. These half-orcs are called hateful ragers. A hateful rager has the following class features.<br /><br />Reduced Rage (Ex): At 2nd level and every level thereafter, a hateful rager only gains 1 additional round of rage per day instead of the normal 2 additional rounds of rage per day.<br /><br />Favored Enemy (Ex): At 2nd level, a hateful rager selects a favored enemy.

If aware of the presence of a favored enemy, the hateful rager must make a DC 20 Will save each round to attack another creature; failure means the barbarian must attack the favored enemy or move closer to that enemy. She may freely attack creatures preventing her from reaching that favored enemy (regardless of whether they are actively trying to prevent her attacks or merely in the way).

Even when forced to mingle with civilization, the true primitive stays apart in both traditions and trappings.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A true primitive is proficient with hide armor and armors made from bone. A true primitive is also proficient with bone shields and the following weapons: battleaxe, blowgun, club, greatclub, handaxe, longspear, shortspear, sling, and spear.<br /><br />Illiteracy: A true primitive cannot read or write, and her superstition about such things leads her to refuse to ever learn to read or write, even if she multiclasses into other classes.<br /><br />Favored Terrain (Ex): A true primitive has a favored terrain representing her native homeland. This ability functions as the ranger class feature, and the true primitive&rsquo;s bonuses in that terrain improve by +2 at 5th level and every five levels thereafter. However, she does not gain any additional favored terrains.

When wielding that weapon, the true primitive gains a +1 morale bonus on damage rolls. Furthermore, if that weapon has the fragile property, once per day, the true primitive can ignore the effects of a single natural 1 roll.
