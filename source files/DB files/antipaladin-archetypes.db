{"_id":"2vkPUb4uwUmPoHjp","name":"Paladin (Seal-Breaker)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy95b1?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Combat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inner Sea Combat pg. 43</a><br />Seal-breakers are dedicated to the Whispering Tyrant and have tasked themselves with finding and destroying the seals that bind him within Gallowspire. Their ties to the Whispering Tyrant give them power over undead creatures and other dark forces.<br /><br />Aura of the Grave (Su): At 3rd level, a seal-breaker is constantly surrounded by the chill of death. Mindless undead within 10 feet of the seal-breaker will not attack him unless directly ordered to, and even then only after succeeding at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the seal-breaker&rsquo;s level + his Charisma modifier). This ability replaces aura of cowardice.<br /><br />Corpse Rider (Su): Upon reaching 5th level, a sealbreaker receives a boon from beyond the grave. This boon can take one of two forms: the seal-breaker can choose to form a bond with his weapon, or he can choose to animate an undead mount to ride.<br /><br />If a bonded weapon is selected, this ability works exactly like the antipaladin&rsquo;s fiendish boon ability.<br /><br />If the undead mount ability is selected, the sealbreaker gains the ability to reanimate any Large corpse (or a Medium corpse for Small seal-breakers) as his corpse mount. If no such corpse is present, the seal-breaker cannot summon his mount. The corpse animates as a quadruped of the same size that the seal-breaker can ride, regardless of the corpse&rsquo;s living form. This corpse mount functions as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Companion\">druid&rsquo;s animal companion</a>&nbsp;using the seal-breaker&rsquo;s level as his effective druid level. The mount has the same base statistics as a heavy horse, pony, boar, camel, or dog (based on its size) with the following changes: its type changes to undead, it has a good Will save and bad Fortitude and Reflex saves, it uses the base creature&rsquo;s Constitution score as its Charisma score (and likewise applies all level-based advancements to Charisma instead of Constitution), and it has an Intelligence score of at least 6. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces fiendish boon.<br /><br />Aura of Death (Su): At 8th level, a seal-breaker radiates an aura that causes undead creatures within 10 feet to gain a +2 profane bonus on all saving throws. This ability replaces aura of despair.<br /><br />Aura of Rebirth (Su): At 11th level, if a living creature is slain within 10 feet of the seal-breaker, the seal-breaker can spend two uses of his smite good ability at the start of his next turn as a standard action to summon the spirit of a dead murderer to reanimate the corpse as a mohrg. The mohrg immediately rises and attacks the seal breaker&rsquo;s foes, acting under the antipaladin&rsquo;s command. After 1 minute, the murderer&rsquo;s soul leaves the body, which collapses, again lifeless. At 15th level, the seal-breaker can activate this ability as a move action. At 19th level, he can activate this ability as a swift action. This ability replaces aura of vengeance.<br /><br />Code of Conduct: The seal-breaker is dedicated to releasing the Whispering Tyrant from his prison. If a sealbreaker willingly and altruistically commits a good act, he loses all class features except proficiencies. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that a seal-breaker can&rsquo;t take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always lead toward the eventual release of the Whispering Tyrant. A seal-breaker&rsquo;s code requires that he place the ultimate release of Tar-Baphon above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just (provided such actions don&rsquo;t interfere with his ultimate goal).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Antipaladin","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/shadow_03.jpg"}

They care nothing for the intricacies of divine spellcasting, but malevolent energy still surrounds them. Whether alone or at the head of a marauding host, these cruel warriors bring suffering and death&mdash;but their presence also heralds the coming of a greater evil.<br /><br />Dread vanguards have the following class features.<br /><br />Beacon of Evil (Su): A dread vanguard unleashes the powers of his vile masters to strengthen both himself and his allies.<br /><br />At 4th level and every 4 level thereafter, a dread vanguard gains one additional use of his touch of corruption ability per day. As a standard action, he can spend a use of his touch of corruption ability to manifest the darkness in his soul as an area of flickering shadows with a 30-foot radius centered on him. These shadows don&rsquo;t affect visibility. The antipaladin and all allies in the area gain a +1 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear, and also ignore the first 5 points of hardness when attacking unattended inanimate objects. This lasts for 1 minute, as long as the dread vanguard is conscious.<br /><br />At 8th level, the aura grants fast healing 3 to the dread vanguard as well as to his allies while they remain within it. Additionally, while this aura is active, the antipaladin can use his touch of corruption ability against any targets within its radius by making a ranged touch attack.<br /><br />At 12th level, when he activates this ability, a dread vanguard can choose to increase the radius of one antipaladin aura he possesses to 30 feet. Also, the morale bonus granted to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +2.<br /><br />At 16th level, the fast healing granted by this ability increases to 5. Additionally, the antipaladin&rsquo;s weapons and those of his allies within the aura&rsquo;s radius are considered evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br /><br />At 20th level, the beacon of evil&rsquo;s radius increases to 60 feet, and the morale bonus granted to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +4. Lastly, attacks made by the dread vanguard and his allies within the aura&rsquo;s radius are infused with pure unholy power, and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage.<br /><br />This ability replaces the spells class feature. A dread vanguard does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items, and does not have a caster level from this class.<br /><br />Dark Emissary (Sp): At 14th level, a dread vanguard becomes a true messenger of the forces of darkness he serves. Once per day, the dread vanguard can expend two uses of his touch of corruption ability to mark one location within 60 feet with the stain of evil. This location can be any point in space, but the ability works best if placed on an altar, shrine, or other site important to a community. The location is affected as if by a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=desecrate\">desecrate</a>&nbsp;spell. Creatures approaching within 30 feet of the site must succeed at a Will save or suffer the effects of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=crushing%20despair\">crushing despair</a>.<br /><br />At 17th level, the dread vanguard can also mark the site with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=symbol%20of%20pain\">symbol of pain</a>, and at 20th level, he adds a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=symbol%20of%20weakness\">symbol of weakness</a>. If available, all three of these effects overlap. Creatures must save against each effect individually, and the effects stack. The caster level for all effects is equal to the dread vanguard&rsquo;s class level. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin&rsquo;s level + his Charisma modifier. A location remains marked in this way for up to 1 day per antipaladin level. During this time, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=crushing%20despair\">crushing despair</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;symbols&nbsp;are triggered when the first target enters each spell&rsquo;s area. They remain active for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again if targets are within range. If the effects are disabled, they become inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Dispel%20magic\">Dispel magic</a>&nbsp;and similar spells suppress the effects, and all effects of dark emissary can be removed by a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=consecrate\">consecrate</a>&nbsp;spell cast on the location by a cleric of a level equal to or higher than the dread vanguard.<br /><br />Allies or evil creatures who serve the same power or organization as the dread vanguard are immune to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=crushing%20despair\">crushing despair</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;symbol&nbsp;effects, and automatically know that the location has been marked for their masters.

At 14th level, a dread vanguard can have one marked site active at a time. At 17th and 20th levels, he can add one additional site that is simultaneously active.

Shunning the ties that bind them to a single deity, insinuators embrace whatever forces help them achieve their own agenda and glory, borrowing power to emulate divine warriors.<br /><br />Alignment: Any evil.<br /><br />Code of Conduct: An insinuator must always work toward his own self-interest, enrichment, or glory, and must also abide by the moral strictures of whatever outsider they have chosen to invoke that day (see invocation below). If the insinuator breaks an invoked outsider&rsquo;s code, he cannot invoke outsiders of that same alignment until he seeks atonement, although outsiders of other alignments may still heed his call.<br /><br />Invocation (Ex): At the start of each day, an insinuator can meditate for 10 minutes to contact and barter with an outsider to empower him for a day. An insinuator can freely invoke an outsider of his own alignment. He can instead invoke an outsider within one step of his own alignment by succeeding at a Diplomacy or Knowledge (religion) skill check (DC = 15 + the insinuator&rsquo;s antipaladin level). While invoking the power of an outsider, the insinuator radiates an alignment aura that matches that of the outsider&rsquo;s, and becomes vulnerable to alignment-based effects that target that outsider&rsquo;s alignment (such as smite evil or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=chaos%20hammer\">chaos hammer</a>). None of an insinuator&rsquo;s supernatural or spell-like class abilities function unless he has invoked the power of an outsider, and the alignment of the being invoked may affect how some abilities function.<br /><br />This ability replaces aura of evil.<br /><br />Detect Balance (Sp): At will, an insinuator can detect strong moral leanings. This functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=detect%20evil\">detect evil</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=detect%20good\">detect good</a>, but does not actually reveal the target&rsquo;s alignment, only whether the target is neutral (rather than good or evil) and the relative strength of that aura. This ability alters detect good.<br /><br />Smite Impudence (Su): Once per day, an insinuator can beseech the forces empowering him to punish their shared enemies. As a swift action, the insinuator chooses one target within sight to smite. An insinuator cannot use smite against a target that shares an alignment with the outsider he has invoked for the day. The insinuator adds his Charisma bonus on his attack rolls and half his insinuator level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target is an outsider, dragon, or divine spellcaster with an alignment opposed to that of the outsider he has invoked for the day, the bonus damage on the first successful attack increases to 1 point of damage per antipaladin level the insinuator has. Regardless of the target, the smite attack automatically bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess. In addition, each time the insinuator declares a smite, he gains a number of temporary hit points equal to his antipaladin level.<br /><br />The smite effect remains until the target is defeated or the next time the insinuator rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, the insinuator can use smite one additional time per day, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level. This ability replaces smite good.<br /><br />Selfish Healing (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, an insinuator can heal his wounds by touch. This is treated exactly like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Paladin\">paladin&rsquo;s lay on hands class feature</a>, except it can be used only to heal the insinuator and cannot be used on other creatures. This ability replaces touch of corruption.<br /><br />Aura of Ego (Su): At 3rd level, an insinuator radiates an aura that bolsters allies and deters enemies. Each ally within 10 feet gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. Enemies within 10 feet take a &ndash;2 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while the insinuator is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead. This ability replaces aura of cowardice.<br /><br />Stubborn Health (Ex): At 3rd level, an insinuator takes only half damage from diseases and poisons, and none of his ability scores can be reduced below 1 by these effects. This ability replaces plague bringer.<br /><br />Greeds (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, an insinuator can heal himself of certain conditions. This functions as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Paladin\">mercy paladin class ability</a>, but these mercies can only be applied to the insinuator himself. This ability replaces cruelty.<br /><br />Channel Energy (Su): At 4th level, an insinuator can channel negative energy, treating his antipaladin level as his effective cleric level. If he invokes a neutral outsider for the day, he may instead chose during the invocation to channel positive energy, but treats his effective cleric level as half his antipaladin level. Using this ability consumes two uses of his selfish healing ability. This is a Charisma-based ability. This ability alters channel negative energy.<br /><br />Bonus Feats: At 4th level, an insinuator gains one bonus feat, which must be selected from the list of combat feats or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Skill%20Focus\">Skill Focus</a>. At 7th level and every 3 antipaladin levels thereafter, the insinuator gains one additional combat or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Skill%20Focus\">Skill Focus</a>&nbsp;feat. This ability replaces antipaladin spells.<br /><br />Ambitious Bond (Sp): At 5th level, an insinuator gains a divine bond with either a bonded weapon or an outsider servant. This functions as the antipaladin&rsquo;s fiendish boon with the following modifications.<br /><br />Bonded Weapon: This functions as the antipaladin ability, except the first special ability added to a weapon must correspond to the alignment of the outsider the insinuator has invoked for that day:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Anarchic\">anarchic</a>&nbsp;(chaos),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Axiomatic\">axiomatic</a>&nbsp;(law), or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Unholy\">unholy</a>&nbsp;(evil). Additional special abilities may be applied if any equivalent bonus remains.<br /><br />Outsider Servant: This functions as the antipaladin ability, except the insinuator gains a new outsider servant each day, whose alignment must match the alignment of the outsider invoked for the day. The outsider servant functions as much as an agent for the patron invoked by the insinuator as an ally of the insinuator himself, and may turn against him if he violates his patron&rsquo;s alignment or interests.<br /><br />Aura of Ambition (Su): At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an insinuator take a &ndash;1 penalty on all saving throws. All allies within 10 feet gain a +1 bonus on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of the crusader. This ability functions only while the insinuator is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead. This ability replaces aura of despair.<br /><br />Aura of Glory (Su): At 11th level, an insinuator can expend two uses of his smite impudence ability to grant the ability to smite impudence to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite impudence ability before the start of the insinuator&rsquo;s next turn, and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. This ability replaces aura of vengeance.<br /><br />Aura of Belief (Su): At 14th level, an insinuator&rsquo;s weapons are treated as chaos-aligned while he invokes a chaotic outsider, law-aligned when he invokes a lawful outsider, or evil-aligned while he invokes an evil outsider. If he invokes an outsider with more than one alignment aura, the insinuator must choose during the initial invocation which alignment his weapon radiates. This ability replaces aura of sin.<br /><br />Aura of Indomitability (Su): At 17th level, an insinuator gains DR 10 that is bypassed by the alignment opposite of the outsider he has invoked for the day, or DR 5/&mdash; while invoking a neutral outsider. This ability replaces aura of depravity.<br /><br />Personal Champion (Su): At 20th level, an insinuator becomes a living embodiment of his selfish desires. His damage resistance from aura of indomitability increases to 15 (or 10 while invoking a neutral outsider). Whenever he uses smite impudence, he adds twice his full Charisma bonus to the attack roll and doubles his effective bonus damage gained from the smite. In addition, he can invoke a new outsider patron by meditating for 10 minutes. This ability replaces unholy champion.</p>\n<h2>Ex-Insinuators</h2>\n<p>An insinuator who willfully commits self less acts or engages in violence that doesn&rsquo;t further his own ends loses all class features (including his outsider servant, but not bonus feats or weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He can&rsquo;t progress any further in levels as an insinuator. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his faltering ambition (see the&nbsp;atonement&nbsp;spell). If he violates the code of conduct of his invoked outsider patron, he must similarly seek atonement from outsiders of that alignment again.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Antipaladin","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/shadow_03.jpg"}

Tyrants are manipulative and lawful antipaladins, chess masters who arrange things behind the scenes to ensure that whatever happens, evil always wins, and the tyrant along with it. Unlike other antipaladins, tyrants are all too happy to associate with good creatures, the better to manipulate them into performing evil acts.<br /><br />Tyrant&rsquo;s Code: A tyrant must be of lawful evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean the tyrant can&rsquo;t take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ambitions. A tyrant&rsquo;s code requires that he place his own sinister goals above all else, respect rightful authority even as he twists its loopholes to his own ends, impose tyranny, and punish all those who dare dissent. A tyrant can accept underlings of any alignment; he cares not who serves him, only that they are truly loyal to him. He can even work alongside good-aligned individuals, as long as he is secretly manipulating them.<br /><br />This alters the antipaladin&rsquo;s code of conduct and associated abilities, as well as the section on ex-antipaladins.<br /><br />Class Skills: A tyrant adds Diplomacy to his list of class skills, instead of Ride.<br /><br />This alters the antipaladin&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Diabolic Boon (Sp): At 5th level, if a tyrant chooses to gain the services of a fiendish servant with his fiendish boon ability, he must choose a fiendish animal or a creature with the lawful and evil subtypes.<br /><br />This ability alters fiendish boon.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Antipaladin","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/shadow_03.jpg"}

These antipaladins&rsquo; armor is an outward symbol of their inner power, and they are rarely seen without it. Iron tyrants seek the strength to rule over domains as unfettered despots, and depend on their armor as protection against those they have not yet cowed.<br /><br />Most iron tyrants are orcs or half-orcs who worship the orc deities&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Lanishra\">Lanishra (god of slavery, subjugation, and tyranny)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Varg\">Varg (god of iron, siege weapons, and warfare)</a>. Though rarer, some iron tyrants belong to other races and worship&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Urazra\">Urazra (giant god of battle, brutality, and strength)</a>&nbsp;or demon lords such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Aldinach\">Aldinach (She of the Six Venoms)</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Angazhan\">Angazhan (the Ravenous King)</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Izyagna\">Izyagna (She of the Sevenfold Swarm)</a>.<br /><br />Iron Fist (Ex): At 2nd level, an iron tyrant gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. In addition, whenever the iron tyrant makes a successful attack with a gauntlet, spiked gauntlet, or armor spikes, the weapon damage is based on his level and not the weapon type, as per the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Warpriest\">warpriest&rsquo;s sacred weapon ability</a>.<br /><br />This ability replaces touch of corruption.<br /><br />Bonus Feats: At 3rd level and every 3 antipaladin levels thereafter, an iron tyrant gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. This feat must be a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?Category=Combat\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;that relates to the iron tyrant&rsquo;s armor or shield, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shield%20Focus\">Shield Focus</a>, or one of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?Category=Armor%20Mastery\">armor mastery feats</a>.<br /><br />This ability replaces cruelty.<br /><br />Unstoppable (Ex): At 4th level, when wearing heavy armor, an iron tyrant is not slowed by terrain that halves movement (such as dense rubble, light undergrowth, and shallow bogs). Terrain that has been magically manipulated to impede motion or terrain that reduces movement by more than half still affects him.<br /><br />This ability replaces channel negative energy.<br /><br />Fiendish Bond (Su): At 5th level, instead of forming a fiendish bond with his weapon or a servant, an iron tyrant can form a bond with his armor. As a standard action, an iron tyrant can enhance his armor by calling upon a fiendish spirit&rsquo;s aid. This bond lasts for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the armor to shed unholy light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 3 antipaladin levels beyond 5th, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses stack with existing armor enhancement bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following armor special abilities:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicArmorDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Dastard\">dastard</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicArmorDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch\">ghost touch</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicArmorDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Fortification%20(light)\">fortification (heavy, light, or medium)</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicArmorDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Invulnerability\">invulnerability</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicArmorDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Spell%20Resistance%20(13)\">spell resistance (13, 15, 17, or 19)</a>. Adding these special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the special ability&rsquo;s base price modifier. In addition, the iron tyrant can grant his armor the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicArmorDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Unrighteous\">unrighteous</a>&nbsp;special ability at the cost of a +4 bonus. These special abilities are added to any special abilities the armor already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. The bonus and special abilities granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the armor is worn by anyone other than the iron tyrant, but it resumes giving bonuses if the iron tyrant dons the armor again. An iron tyrant can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.<br /><br />If a suit of bonded armor with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the iron tyrant loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the iron tyrant takes a &ndash;1 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls.<br /><br />This ability replaces fiendish boon.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Antipaladin","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/shadow_03.jpg"}

As a swift action, the blighted myrmidon chooses one target within sight to smite. Regardless of its alignment, if the target is an animal, plant, or vermin, the blighted myrmidon adds her Charisma bonus (if any) on her attack rolls and adds her blighted myrmidon level on damage rolls against the target of her smite. If the target of smite nature is an elemental, a fey, or a creature with levels of druid, hunter, ranger, or shifter, the bonus on damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per class level the blighted myrmidon has. This ability otherwise functions as smite good.<br /><br />This alters smite good.<br /><br />Corrupted Companion (Sp): At 5th level, a blighted myrmidon can call upon a corrupted servant of nature.

When the blighted myrmidon damages a creature with her smite nature ability, she gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for 1 round.<br /><br />This replaces the use of smite good gained at 10th level.<br /><br />Aura of Decay (Su): At 11th level, as a free action, a blighted myrmidon can expend two uses of her smite nature ability to generate an aura of decay with a range of 10 feet for 1 minute. Living foes of the blighted myrmidon within the aura take 3d6 points of damage unless they succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = half the blighted myrmidon&rsquo;s level + her Charisma modifier) for half damage. If an elemental, a fey, or a creature with levels in druid, hunter, ranger, or shifter takes damage from aura of decay, the blighted myrmidon regains a number of hit points equal to half the amount of damage the creature takes; this doesn&rsquo;t stack if multiple such creatures are in the aura.<br /><br />This replaces aura of vengeance.<br /><br />Enervating Touch (Su): At 15th level, when she damages a creature with her touch of corruption, a blighted myrmidon can suppress the vital force of her target for 1 round per level. While affected, when the target regains hit points, it regains only half the number of hit points it would otherwise receive, and it can&rsquo;t gain temporary hit points. The target can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = half the blighted myrmidon&rsquo;s level + her Charisma modifier) to negate this effect.<br /><br />This replaces the cruelty gained at 15th level.<br /><br />Unnatural Champion (Ex): At 20th level, when a blighted myrmidon uses smite nature and strikes an elemental or fey creature with the extraplanar subtype, the target is also subject to the effects of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=banishment\">banishment</a>&nbsp;spell, using her blighted myrmidon level as her caster level, and her weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates.
