But these mortal clerics are often just shallow beings searching for quick power or the caress of true and final oblivion&mdash;few truly grasp the full scope of the entities they worship. Fiendish vessels, through their fiendish heritage, share an innate connection with their patron, and that connection grants them understanding and power. A fiendish vessel has the following class features.<br /><br />Alignment: Unlike normal clerics, a fiendish vessel&rsquo;s alignment must match her patron&rsquo;s.<br /><br />Domains: A fiendish vessel must select the Daemon, Demon, or Devil subdomain ( 88&ndash;90) as one of her domain choices, based on the fiendish patron she chooses to serve.<br /><br />Channel Evil (Su): At 1st level, a fiendish vessel, rather than channeling positive or negative energy, instead channels the pure evil power of her fiendish patron. This ability is similar to channeling negative energy, but instead of healing undead and dealing damage to living creatures, this blast of evil energy automatically heals evil creatures and debilitates good creatures within its burst.<br /><br />Channeling this evil causes a burst that affects all creatures in a 30-foot radius centered on the fiendish vessel. In the case of evil creatures, the amount of damage healed is equal to 1d4 points of damage and increases by 1d4 at every two levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d4 at 19th level). Good creatures in the burst receive a Will saving throw to negate this damage. Good creatures that fail their saving throws are sickened for 1d4 rounds. Good creatures with a number of Hit Dice less than or equal to the fiendish vessel&rsquo;s class level &ndash; 5 that fail their saving throws are nauseated for 1 round and then sickened for 1d4 rounds instead. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the fiendish vessel&rsquo;s level + the fiendish vessel&rsquo;s Charisma bonus. Neutral creatures are unaffected by this burst of evil energy.<br /><br />A fiendish vessel may channel this energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Doing so is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A fiendish vessel can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect. A fiendish vessel must present her unholy symbol or use her familiar as the divine focus for this ability.<br /><br />For the purposes of feats that affect channel energy, this ability counts as channeling negative energy. If the feat changes the way the fiendish vessel channels or deals damage with her channeling, use the amount of damage this ability heals evil creatures to determine the damage-dealing potential of the affected ability. For instance, if a 5th-level fiendish vessel takes the Channel Smite feat, her channeling deals an additional 3d4 points of damage to living creatures on a successful hit (though they may save to negate the damage).<br /><br />This ability replaces channel energy.<br /><br />Fiendish Familiar: At 3rd level, a fiendish vessel&rsquo;s patron rewards her with a fiendish servant. The fiendish vessel gains an imp, quasit, or cacodaemon familiar based on the patron she worships. This ability is identical to the wizard&rsquo;s arcane bond with a familiar and the Improved Familiar feat, using the fiendish vessel&rsquo;s character level in place of the wizard level.<br /><br />This tiny fiend acts like a perverse, manifest moral compass. Furthermore, this familiar can act as a living divine focus and unholy symbol for her spellcasting if the fiendish vessel so desires, which means that when she uses her channel evil ability, its burst can be centered on the familiar instead, as long as that familiar is within 30 feet and line of sight. A fiendish vessel&rsquo;s familiar tends to be fawning and subservient to the fiendish vessel. Should her familiar die, the fiendish vessel&rsquo;s patron replaces the familiar with an identical one within 1 week, without the need for a special ritual. Furthermore, the fiendish familiar gains the following special abilities beyond the standard familiar special abilities.<br /><br />Fiendish Augury (Sp): At 3rd level, the fiendish vessel can ask the familiar whether a particular course of action will bring good or bad results for her in the immediate future. This ability acts like the&nbsp;augury&nbsp;spell, with a caster level equal to the fiendish vessel&rsquo;s level, with the familiar acting as the mouthpiece for the spell. This ability can be used once per day.<br /><br />Fiendish Divination (Sp): At 9th level, the fiendish vessel can use a more powerful form of divination to gain intelligence from her patron through her fiendish familiar. This ability acts like the&nbsp;divination&nbsp;spell, with a caster level equal to the fiendish vessel&rsquo;s level; the familiar acts as the mouthpiece for the spell. This ability can be used once per day.<br /><br />Extra Divination (Sp): At 13th level, the fiendish vessel can gain intelligence from her patron more often each day. She can use fiendish divination up to 3 times per day.<br /><br />Fiendish Summoning: When casting&nbsp;summon monster&nbsp;spells, a fiendish vessel is limited to summoning fiendish creatures and evil outsiders of the same alignment as her patron</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Cleric","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-cross.jpg"}

She is so focused on that area that she eschews the broader sweep of her deity&rsquo;s dogma and focuses intensely upon that aspect of it, embodying its power in all she does. Theologians tend to be more zealous than other clerics, and many crusades are started by theologians. A theologian has the following class features.<br /><br />Focused Domain: A theologian chooses only one domain from her deity&rsquo;s portfolio rather than the normal two domains. All level-dependent effects of the granted powers from the theologian&rsquo;s domain function as if she were two cleric levels higher than her actual cleric level. This does not allow her to gain domain-granted powers earlier than normal.<br /><br />A theologian can prepare domain spells using her non-domain slots. She cannot use her spontaneous casting ability on domain spells, even if they are prepared in non-domain slots. In all other respects, this works like and replaces the standard cleric domain ability.<br /><br />Domain Secret (Ex): At 5th level, the theologian chooses one domain spell. That spell becomes permanently modified with one of the following metamagic feats: Bouncing Spell, Disruptive Spell, Ectoplasmic Spell, Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Focused Spell, Intensified Spell, Silent Spell, Still Spell. This metamagic feat does not increase the level of the spell. Once chosen, this modification cannot be changed. The domain specialist need not have the metamagic feat to apply it to a spell using this ability.

Angelfire apostles typically follow Sarenrae, but a few serve empyreal lords such as Ragathiel.<br /><br />Armor Proficiency: Angelfire apostles are not proficient with medium armor.<br /><br />This ability alters the cleric&rsquo;s armor proficiency.<br /><br />Diminished Spellcasting: An angelfire apostle is less concerned with the traditional divine magic that many religious adherents receive. The angelfire apostle receives one fewer spell slot at each spell level. When an angelfire apostle gets no spells per day at a spell level, he can cast domain spells of that level normally, but can only cast nondomain spells of that level if he gets them as bonus spells.<br /><br />This ability alters the cleric&rsquo;s spellcasting.<br /><br />Extra Channel: At 1st level, the angelfire apostle gains Extra Channel as a bonus feat.<br /><br />Channel Angelfire (Su): An angelfire apostle must be of good or neutral alignment and must choose to channel positive energy, even if his deity is neutral or if he is not devoted to a particular deity. When an angelfire apostle channels positive energy, affected nongood creatures are dazzled for 1 round, with no saving throw for this effect, in addition to experiencing the normal effects of channel energy.<br /><br />This ability alters channel energy.<br /><br />Versatile Healing Channel (Sp): At 5th level, the angelfire apostle can spend two uses of his channel energy ability to cast&nbsp;remove blindness/deafness&nbsp;or&nbsp;lesser restoration&nbsp;as a spell-like ability. At 7th level, he can choose&nbsp;remove disease&nbsp;or&nbsp;remove paralysis. At 9th level, he can choose&nbsp;neutralize poison. At 11th level, he can choose&nbsp;breath of life. At 13th level, he can choose&nbsp;heal. At 15th level, he can choose&nbsp;regenerate. At 17th level, he can choose&nbsp;restoration&nbsp;but cannot affect permanent negative levels. At 19th level, he can choose&nbsp;resurrection&nbsp;but can affect only a target that has been dead no more than 1 round per his cleric level.<br /><br />Cleansing Flames (Su): At 9th level, the angelfire apostle becomes a direct conduit for the righteous power of his deity. Whenever the angelfire apostle casts a spell that belongs to the healing subschool that is a lower spell level than the highest spell he can cast, he can unleash a blast of flames as a swift action by expending one use of his channel energy ability. The flames last for 1 round and fill a contiguous area equal to one 10-foot cube per level of the healing spell cast (at least one side of the cube must be adjacent to the angelfire apostle&rsquo;s space). The flames deal 1d4 points of damage per spell level. Half of the damage is fire damage, and half is raw divine power not subject to fire resistance or immunity. Any creature in the area can halve the damage with a successful Reflex saving throw against the spell&rsquo;s DC. The angelfire apostle can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Cleric","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-cross.jpg"}

They might see themselves as an incarnation of their deity in the flesh, or they could simply seek to embody the physical and spiritual ideals set forth by their deity. Many divine paragons go as far as to alter their appearance, as best as possible, to look similar to their chosen deity, but such a level of devotion is not required by the archetype.<br /><br />Devoted Domain: A divine paragon is intensely devoted to a single deity, and her alignment must be identical to her deity&rsquo;s alignment. She gains Deific ObedienceISG&nbsp;as a bonus feat, even if she doesn&rsquo;t meet the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites. She gains access to her boons at an accelerated rate (see below) rather than the standard HD-based rate granted by Deific Obedience (and as such cannot benefit from the accelerated rate granted by the Diverse Obedience feat).<br /><br />When the divine paragon selects her domains, she must designate one of the two domains she gains as her devoted domain. She gains all of this domain&rsquo;s granted powers and domain spells normally. For her other domain, she gains only its domain spells&mdash;she does not gain any of the granted powers of that domain. Instead, she must choose from the evangelist, exalted, or sentinel boons granted by her deity (as detailed in&nbsp;Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods). At 5th level, she gains access to the first boon granted by her deity. At 11th level, she gains access to the second boon. At 14th level, she gains access to the third boon.<br /><br />In order to retain access to her domain spells, the domain powers of her devoted domain, and the boons granted by Deific Obedience, the divine paragon must perform her obedience daily. If she fails to do so, she loses access to these abilities until she next performs her obedience (but she can still cast spells, channel energy, and perform other abilities granted by her cleric levels).<br /><br />This ability alters domains.<br /><br />Divine Brand (Ex): At 1st level, a mark appears somewhere on the divine paragon&rsquo;s body. The mark&rsquo;s location varies by individual and faith, but takes the form of the deity&rsquo;s holy symbol and generally appears in a location easy to display, such as on the hand, forearm, chest, or face. An uncovered divine brand functions as a holy (or unholy) symbol and as a divine focus for spellcasting. The divine paragon&rsquo;s aura is even more powerful than a typical cleric&rsquo;s as a result of her devotion, and her cleric level is treated as 1 higher for the purpose of determining the strength of her aura when it is viewed by spells like detect good.<br /><br />This ability alters aura.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Cleric","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-cross.jpg"}

This replaces the cleric&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Ecclesitheurge&rsquo;s Vow: At 1st level, an ecclesitheurge makes a vow to his deity to be protected solely by his faith, not by armor or shields. An ecclesitheurge who wears armor or uses a shield is unable to use his blessing of the faithful ability, use cleric domain powers, or cast cleric spells.<br /><br />Blessing of the Faithful (Su): As a standard action, the ecclesitheurge can bless one ally within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). A blessed ally gains a +2 sacred or profane bonus (depending on whether the ecclesitheurge channels positive or negative energy) on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, or saving throws or to AC until the ecclesitheurge&rsquo;s next turn. The ecclesitheurge can expend 1 use of channel energy when activating this ability to increase the duration to a number of rounds equal to the number of dice of his channel energy.<br /><br />Domain Mastery: At 1st level, when an ecclesitheurge chooses his cleric domains, he designates one as his primary domain and the other as his secondary domain. An ecclesitheurge can use his non-domain spell slots to prepare spells from his primary domain&rsquo;s spell list.<br /><br />Each day when he prepares spells, an ecclesitheurge can select a different domain granted by his deity to gain access to that domain&rsquo;s spell list instead of his secondary domain spell list. He does not lose access to his actual secondary domain&rsquo;s granted powers or gain access to the other domain&rsquo;s granted powers. For example, an ecclesitheurge of Sarenrae with Glory and his primary domain and Good as his secondary domain can choose to gain access to the Healing domain; until the next time he prepares spells, he uses the Healing domain spell list as his secondary domain spell list instead of the Good domain spell list, but still keeps the granted powers of the Good domain and does not gain the granted powers of the Healing domain.<br /><br />This ability alters the normal domain ability.<br /><br />Bonded Holy Symbol (Su): At 3rd level, an ecclesitheurge forms a powerful bond with a holy symbol of his deity, which functions identically to a wizard&rsquo;s bonded object except it can be used to cast cleric and domain spells (instead of wizard spells) and the ecclesitheurge can grant his bonded holy symbol only magic abilities appropriate for a holy symbol or a neck slot item.<br /><br />As with a wizard&rsquo;s bonded item, an ecclesitheurge can add additional magic abilities to his bonded holy symbol as if he had the required item creation feat (typically Craft Wondrous Item), provided he meets the feat&rsquo;s level prerequisites. For example, an ecclesitheurge with a bonded holy symbol who wants to add a wondrous amulet ability, like&nbsp;amulet of natural armor, to his bonded holy symbol must be at least 3rd level to do so. The magic properties of a bonded holy symbol, including any magic abilities the ecclesitheurge added to the object, function for only the ecclesitheurge.

A herald caller can choose only one domain from her deity&rsquo;s list of domains, rather than the normal two domains, and she doesn&rsquo;t gain proficiency with medium armor or shields. This ability alters the cleric&rsquo;s domains and armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Call Heralds (Su): A herald caller can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn&rsquo;t prepared ahead of time. She can lose a prepared spell in order to cast any&nbsp;summon monster&nbsp;spell of the same level or lower. She gains a +1 bonus on concentration checks to cast a&nbsp;summon monster&nbsp;spell defensively.

This includes all creatures listed as&nbsp;summon monster&nbsp;options for priests of her deity (see Expanded Summoning for Priests on page 30), creatures whose alignment matches at least one aspect of her deity&rsquo;s alignment, and creatures of an elemental subtype that matches a domain granted by the deity (if any). When summoning a creature that is normally summoned with the celestial or fiendish template, a herald caller of a chaotic deity can instead summon it with the entropic template, and a herald caller of a lawful deity can instead summon it with the resolute template (see pages 292&ndash;293 of&nbsp;Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2&nbsp;for more information on these simple templates).<br /><br />Because of these summoned monsters&rsquo; strong ties to the herald caller&rsquo;s deity, the herald caller also gains specific benefits with creatures she summons with&nbsp;summon monster&nbsp;spells gained from her cleric spell list. The herald caller and her summoned monsters can understand each other&rsquo;s spoken words as if they shared a common language (though this doesn&rsquo;t give summoned monsters the ability to speak if they normally lack it). Whenever the herald caller uses channel energy to heal, she can include all of her summoned monsters, even if they are out of her normal channel energy radius or of a creature type that would not normally be affected.

These clerics are known as blossoming lights, and forsake armor and weaponry in favor of opening their hearts to pure goodness. Many are peace-loving or even pacifistic, and nearly every blossoming light favors redemption over righteous wrath.<br /><br />Blossoming lights are primarily found among the Lantern Bearers, as their powers are a great boon against the organization&rsquo;s foes. Despite this, their ways did not originate with elvenkind. Legend tells that Sarenrae, horrified by the consequences of the destruction of Gormuz, reached out to one of that city&rsquo;s survivors. She granted the frightened woman divine powers to guide her fellow survivors, both to safety and to goodness, and humbly asked her to spread the message of redemption and forgiveness. While this priestess&rsquo;s identity has been lost to history, the Dawnflower&rsquo;s imparted wisdom has not.<br /><br />Within the Lantern Bearers, given their growing alliance with Sarenrae&rsquo;s faith, the traditions of the blossoming light have found the perfect place to flourish. These clerics are increasingly at the vanguard of the organization&rsquo;s efforts to redeem the fallen, particularly drow who seek to escape their society&rsquo;s strictures.<br /><br />Promise of Faith: A blossoming light vows to trust in her deity&rsquo;s protection over arms and armor. She is not proficient with any armor or shields. The blossoming light cannot use or benefit from any of her class features (including spellcasting) while wearing armor or using a shield, or for 1 minute thereafter.<br /><br />This ability alters the cleric&rsquo;s armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Promise of Purity: A blossoming light must be truly pure of heart. She must be good-aligned and worship a nonevil deity. If the blossoming light willfully commits an evil act, she loses all class features (including spellcasting) until she atones.<br /><br />This alters the cleric&rsquo;s alignment.<br /><br />Luminous Font (Su): A blossoming light forsakes her deity&rsquo;s deeper mysteries to focus on benevolence, healing, and bringing light to darkness. A blossoming light still selects domains and retains access to domain powers, but does not gain domain spell slots. Blossoming lights are beacons of goodness, guiding others to follow their own best natures. A blossoming light adds half her level on Diplomacy checks against good creatures or to convince an evil creature to take an action against its evil nature.<br /><br />A blossoming light&rsquo;s channel energy is usable a number of times per day equal to 5 + her Charisma modifier. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the blossoming light gains an additional use per day of channel energy.<br /><br />At 3rd level, when a blossoming light channels energy to harm undead, her channeled energy also harms chaotic evil outsiders, worshipers of chaotic evil deities, and evil creatures with light sensitivity or light blindness as if they were undead.<br /><br />At 7th level, when a blossoming light channels energy, she can expend an additional use to fill the affected area with bright light (as per&nbsp;daylight) for a number of rounds equal to her cleric level.<br /><br />At 10th level, a blossoming light can use&nbsp;atonement&nbsp;once per day as a spell-like ability, but only to offer redemption to others (as per the spell).

Among these, an even smaller number find that while their original deity no longer answers their prayers, something else does: an unknown entity or force of the universe channeling its power through a trained and practicing vessel.<br /><br />This is an ex-class archetype and can be taken by a character immediately upon becoming an ex-cleric.<br /><br /><br /></p>\n<h3>EX-CLASS ARCHETYPES</h3>\n<p>The following archetype can be taken by an ex-cleric immediately upon becoming an ex-cleric, regardless of character level, replacing some or all of the lost class abilities. If another archetype the character had before she became an ex-cleric replaces the same ability as the ex-class archetype, she loses the old archetype in favor of the new one; otherwise, she can retain both archetypes as normal. Channelers of the unknown can gain further levels in the cleric class, even though becoming an ex-cleric normally prohibits further advancement in the class. While an ex-member of a class can recant her failings and atone for her fall from her original class (typically involving an&nbsp;atonement&nbsp;spell), her acceptance of her ex-class archetype means she must atone both for her initial fall and for further straying from the path. As a result, such a character must be the target of two&nbsp;atonement&nbsp;spells or a similar effect to regain her lost class features. Upon doing so, she immediately loses this archetype and regains her original class (and archetype, if she had one).<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency&nbsp;: A channeler of the unknown loses proficiency with her deity&rsquo;s favored weapon. She instead gains proficiency with one martial or exotic weapon, chosen when she first takes this archetype, which thereafter effectively functions as her holy or unholy symbol for the purposes of class abilities and spellcasting. The weapon chosen cannot be one associated with her former deity. Once she makes this choice, she can&rsquo;t later change it.<br /><br />This alters the cleric&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiency.<br /><br />Spells: A channeler of the unknown has one fewer spell slot per spell level in which she can prepare spells than normal. She is no longer restricted by alignment descriptors, and she gains access to all spells on the cleric spell list, even spells her alignment would normally prohibit.<br /><br />This alters the cleric&rsquo;s spells.<br /><br />Unknown Aura (Su): A channeler of the unknown never radiates an alignment aura, as if under the effect of a permanent&nbsp;undetectable alignment&nbsp;spell.<br /><br />This replaces the cleric&rsquo;s aura.<br /><br />Channel Entropy (Su): A channeler of the unknown can channel entropy as a cleric channels negative or positive energy, releasing a wave of twisting void that harms creatures in the area of effect. The amount of damage dealt is equal to that an evil cleric of her level would deal by channeling negative energy, except it affects living, unliving, and undead creatures alike. This functions in all other ways as a cleric&rsquo;s channel energy class feature, including benefiting from feats that affect channel energy (such as Selective Channeling).<br /><br />This alters channel energy.<br /><br />Power of the Unknown: A channeler of the unknown has lost the benefit of the domains granted by her deity, but the unknown entity that answers her supplications instead grants her the benefits of one domain from the following list: Darkness, Destruction, Luck, Madness, or Void.

{"_id":"WyuZSVgbmlpLJPOA","name":"Cleric (Hidden Priest)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8mfs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inner Sea Magic pg. 35</a><br />Practicing one&rsquo;s religion is not always legal. For example, most lands outlaw worshiping fiends. Taldor has banned the faith of Sarenrae from being openly worshiped. Rahadoum flat-out forbids all religions within its borders. But as time has shown again and again, mere laws are poor deterrents to the worship of dedicated members of such faiths, whether the zealous wish to subvert authority, free the spirits of the oppressed, or merely enjoy the right to practice their beliefs. Clerics in these circumstances must conceal their true natures, practice their magic in secret, and always be on guard for betrayal and discovery. A hidden priest has the following class features.<br /><br />False Arcanist (Ex): At 1st level, a hidden priest is able to disguise his cleric spellcasting, presenting it as arcane magic of some kind. Typically, this is as alchemist, bard, sorcerer, or wizard magic, and the cleric disguises the words and gestures of the cleric spell with accoutrements appropriate to his apparent profession. He must make a skill check (DC 10 + twice the level of the spell) to disguise his casting and successfully cast the spell. The type of skill check depends on the type of caster he pretends to be: Craft (alchemy) for alchemist, Perform for bard, Knowledge (arcana) for sorcerer or wizard. Using Spellcraft to identify the spell works normally, though unless the observer beats the DC by 10 or more, she doesn&rsquo;t suspect the source of the magic is divine.<br /><br />For example, a hidden priest pretending to be an alchemist wants to cast&nbsp;cure light wounds&nbsp;on a wounded townsperson. If he makes a DC 12 Craft (alchemy) check, he disguises his spellcasting as the mixing of an alchemical extract or potion (perhaps with the words disguised as reciting an obscure formula or talking herself through the list of ingredients), which he gives to the target. An observer making a DC 16 Spellcraft check can identify his spell as&nbsp;cure light wounds, but doesn&rsquo;t realize his &ldquo;alchemical&rdquo; methods are a sham unless her check result is 26 or higher.<br /><br />When the hidden priest uses this ability, he must still provide any divine focus components for the spells he casts. However, the divine focus doesn&rsquo;t need to be an obvious symbol of his faith. It could be a small coin, tattoo, or garment bearing the symbol, whether presented openly, disguised, or hidden within a larger picture. For example, a hidden priest of Sarenrae may use a coin with an ankh or sunburst, a complex tattoo or scar that has an ankh shape hidden within it, a glove with an ankh stitched on the inside of the palm, and so on. He must use this replacement divine focus just as he would his true one (for example, he couldn&rsquo;t leave the coin in his shoe). If a spell requires a divine focus with a specific or minimum cost, the replacement divine focus must be of similar value to be used as the divine focus.<br /><br />A hidden priest adds half his class level (minimum +1) on all Bluff skill checks to send secret messages about religious matters, and on all Sense Motive checks to recognize similar messages. He also adds this bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks relating to agents of the laws against his religion (including city guards in lands where these laws are in effect).<br /><br />This ability replaces one of the cleric&rsquo;s two 1st-level domain powers (her choice).<br /><br />Unseen Devotion (Su): At 8th level, a hidden priest can apply the Silent Spell and Still Spell feats to a spell he is about to cast. This does not alter the level of the spell or the casting time. He can use this ability once per day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every four additional cleric levels beyond 8th. Even though this ability does not modify the spell&rsquo;s actual level, he cannot use this ability to cast a spell whose modified spell level would be above the level of the highest-level spell that he is capable of casting. This ability always applies both feats (the cleric cannot use it to just apply one or the other). This ability replaces one of the cleric&rsquo;s two 8th-level domain powers (his choice).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Cleric","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-cross.jpg"}

This alters aura.<br /><br />Channel Utility (Su): An appeaser channels negative energy, but also gains limited access to positive energy. At 5th level, an appeaser can channel positive energy as a full-round action, but he treats his cleric level as if it were 4 lower when determining the amount of damage he can deal to undead and the amount of hit points he can restore to living creatures. This ability alters channel energy.<br /><br />Divine Apologist (Ex): An appeaser must worship an evil god. His alignment must be within one step of his deity&rsquo;s, but he himself cannot have an evil alignment. An appeaser cannot cast any spells with the good or evil descriptor.

The appeaser gains access to any granted powers offered by the domain he would otherwise qualify for, and can sacrifice a prepared spell to cast a domain spell from that domain just as if he were spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell.

Though most members of her faith would call her a separatist or heretic, she continues to receive spells from her deity. Charismatic separatists may develop a large following of like-minded believers and eventually found a splinter church of their deity&mdash;and they are just as likely to be the cause of a holy civil war as the branches of the religion fight to determine which is the true faith.<br /><br />A cleric who does not serve a deity cannot take the separatist archetype. A separatist has the following class features.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Separatists do not gain proficiency in their deity&rsquo;s favored weapon (though they are not prohibited from using it or learning its use).<br /><br />Forbidden Rites: A separatist selects one domain from her deity&rsquo;s domain list, and a second domain that is not on her deity&rsquo;s domain list. This second domain cannot be an alignment domain that doesn&rsquo;t match the cleric&rsquo;s or her deity&rsquo;s alignment. For example, a lawful good separatist cleric of a neutral good deity cannot choose the Chaos or Evil domain with this ability, but can select the Lawful domain even though her deity isn&rsquo;t lawful.<br /><br />Granted powers from the cleric&rsquo;s second domain function as if the cleric&rsquo;s level, Wisdom, and Charisma were 2 lower than normal (minimum level 1) in terms of effect, DC, and uses per day. This also means the separatist doesn&rsquo;t gain the domain&rsquo;s higher-level ability until 2 levels later than normal.

Clerics who live in or near the sea sometimes embrace the watery aspect of Gozreh over the deity&rsquo;s other dimensions and take the title of crashing wave. In aquatic communities, a crashing wave is often a healer and spiritual leader. Such clerics understand the tempestuousness and cruelty of the sea, but also its generosity and bounty.<br /><br />Among aquatic creatures, cecaelias, locathahs, and merfolk are the most likely to walk the path of the crashing wave. Gnomes, halflings, and humans living on coastlines or working aboard ships may also answer the call to become crashing waves.<br /><br />Sworn to the Sea: A crashing wave must select Gozreh as her deity.<br /><br />Speech of the Sea: A crashing wave&rsquo;s bonus language options include Aquan in addition to the bonus languages available to the character from her race. The crashing wave does not gain Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal as bonus language options.<br /><br />This ability alters bonus languages.<br /><br />Balanced Channel (Su): At 1st level, a crashing wave can channel the pure balance of the ocean&mdash;its wildness, its calm, its cruelty, and its gentleness. This energy can be used to harm or heal creatures, as the crashing wave chooses. Channeling this energy causes a 30-foot-radius burst centered on the cleric. Using balanced channel is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A crashing wave can choose whether to include herself in the effect. The cleric must be able to present her holy symbol to use this ability, and she can channel energy a number of times equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.<br /><br />If the crashing wave chooses to harm, creatures within the burst that are chaotic good, chaotic evil, lawful good, or lawful evil take 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every 2 levels the cleric has beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures with a neutral alignment component are unaffected by this energy. Creatures that take damage from the channeled energy can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the crashing wave&rsquo;s level + her Charisma modifier) for half damage. This damage is neither negative nor positive energy, so a creature&rsquo;s resistance to positive or negative energy does not reduce this damage. (However, resistance to channeled energy in particular, such as that provided by channel resistance, applies normally.)<br /><br />If the crashing wave chooses to heal, creatures within the burst that have any neutral alignment component are healed 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every 2 levels the cleric has beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). This healing does not affect creatures that are chaotic good, chaotic evil, lawful good, or lawful evil. This healing is positive energy, so any creatures not healed by positive energy (such as undead) receive no healing from this effect, even if they have a neutral alignment.<br /><br />This ability replaces channel energy.<br /><br />Spontaneous Casting: A crashing wave does not gain the ability to spontaneously cast&nbsp;cure&nbsp;or&nbsp;inflict&nbsp;spells by sacrificing prepared spells. However, a crashing wave can spontaneously cast the following spells by sacrificing a prepared spell of the noted level or higher.<br /><br />This ability alters spontaneous casting.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Spell Level</td>\n<td>Sponantious Spell</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Bless water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>SlipstreamAPG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Water breathing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Control water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>GeyserAPG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Fluid formAPG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Elemental body IV (water only)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>SeamantleAPG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Elemental swarm (water only)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Cleric","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-cross.jpg"}

These clerics see the act of travel and the arrival at sites sacred to their religion as valuable, and perhaps more so than time spent sequestered inside a church. Relatively common in Varisia, these pilgrims love to travel, typically on foot or with caravans. While the archetype is called the &ldquo;Varisian pilgrim,&rdquo; this archetype can be selected by any cleric who prefers to worship while on the move. Whether or not they are Varisian, these clerics learn a little about fortune-telling and a lot about people.<br /><br />A Varisian pilgrim has the following class features.<br /><br />Fortunate Road: At 1st level, a Varisian pilgrim must select the Chaos, Community, Liberation, Luck, Travel, or Weather domain (or the Exploration, Fate, Freedom, Trade, or Seasons subdomains from the&nbsp;Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide, if available in the campaign) as one of her domains. If the cleric worships a deity that doesn&rsquo;t normally grant one of these domains, she gains access to this domain but can only pick this one domain&mdash;she effectively loses the option to pick a second domain. As a result, very few clerics who worship deities who don&rsquo;t grant access to one of the domains or subdomains listed above opt to become Varisian pilgrims. In all other respects, this works like and replaces the standard cleric&rsquo;s domain ability.<br /><br />Caravan Bond (Su): At 1st level, by leading a group prayer for 1 minute, a Varisian pilgrim can select a number of traveling companions equal to her cleric level + her Wisdom bonus. She may use her domain-granted powers on any of these traveling companions as if they were her. She can use these abilities on her traveling companions at a range of up to 30 feet, even if the ability normally requires her touch. This ability replaces the cleric&rsquo;s proficiency with medium armor and shields&mdash; she retains proficiency with light armor only.<br /><br />Blessing of the Harrow (Su): At 8th level, once per day the pilgrim may perform a harrowing for herself or another creature. This is otherwise identical to the blessing of the harrow from the harrower prestige class (Inner Sea World Guide&nbsp;276). This replaces an 8th-level domain power of the Varisian pilgrim&rsquo;s choice.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Cleric","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-cross.jpg"}

At the head of these groups are triadic priests. Although witch covens and changelings are the most likely to pursue this tradition, the practice sometimes appears among other faiths.<br /><br />Triadic Bond (Su): A triadic priest can perform a 10-minute ritual with exactly two allies in order to create an enduring bond between them that lasts until the triadic priest either dissolves the bond (a process that takes 1 minute of concentration) or creates a new bond. When performing the bonding ritual, the triadic priest can also include any of her allies&rsquo; familiars or spirit animals; these creatures gain the benefits of the bonded channeler ability and the drawbacks of being in the bond, but they are not treated as bonded allies for the purpose of the triadic priest&rsquo;s bonded domain. Only intelligent and fully independent creatures can serve as her two bonded companions. Animal companions, eidolons, familiars, phantoms, and similar nonsentient or dependent creatures are not suitable.<br /><br />The bonded allies gain numerous benefits and can help empower the triadic priest&rsquo;s spellcasting, as noted in the abilities below. However, if a bonded ally dies, the other members of the bond must each succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + the triadic priest&rsquo;s class level) or gain 1 permanent negative level.<br /><br />Bonded Channeler (Su): When a triadic priest uses her channel energy ability, she must choose to affect either only her bonded allies or everyone except her bonded allies.<br /><br />Bonded Domain (Su): A triadic priest selects only one domain granted by her deity. However, while she is within 10 feet of least one of her bonded allies, she gains the following benefits.<br /><br />This alters the domains class feature.<br /><br />Bonded Power (Su): A triadic priest gains either a witch&rsquo;s coven hex or the Allied Spellcaster feat as a bonus feat.<br /><br />Bonded Unity (Su): As a move action, a triadic priest can share one teamwork feat she has with up to two bonded companions that are within 10 feet of her. Her bonded companions do not need to meet the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites and gain the benefits of the feat for 1 round plus 1 additional round for every 5 class levels the triadic priest has.

At 8th level, once per day while within 10 feet of both her bonded allies, a triadic priest can cast any one of her domain spells of a spell level she can cast, whether she has prepared the spell or not, without expending a spell slot. If one of these domain spells has a casting time of more than one standard action, the triadic priest must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + double the spell&rsquo;s level) or lose the spell if at any point during the casting she does not have a bonded ally within 10 feet.<br /><br />Domain Spells: 1st&mdash;ill omen, 2nd&mdash;blindness/deafness, 3rd&mdash;bestow curse, 4th&mdash;charm monster, 5th&mdash;baleful polymorph, 6th&mdash;control weather, 7th&mdash;forcecage, 8th&mdash;mind blank, 9th&mdash;astral projection.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Cleric","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-cross.jpg"}

The scroll scholar archetype can be taken by either clerics or wizards&mdash;they give up different class abilities for the new abilities granted by this archetype. A wizard must either be a universalist wizard or a diviner wizard in order to take this archetype&mdash;other types of school specializations are not suited to this archetype&rsquo;s focus. A scroll scholar has the following class features.<br /><br />Diligent Student (Ex): At 1st level, a scroll scholar chooses one Knowledge skill. This becomes a class skill if it is not already one.

For wizards, this ability replaces diviner&rsquo;s fortune (if a diviner) or hand of the apprentice (if a universalist).<br /><br />Secrets Revealed (Sp): At 5th level, a scroll scholar gains the ability to cast&nbsp;comprehend languages&nbsp;and&nbsp;identify&nbsp;as spelllike abilities. Her caster level is equal to her character level in whatever class she took the scroll scholar archetype for. She can cast these spells once per day each at 5th level, twice per day each at 7th level, and three times per day each at 9th level. At 11th level, one of these spell-like abilities (scholar&rsquo;s choice) becomes a constant spell-like ability, and at 13th level, the second one becomes a constant spell-like ability. If the scholar is a cleric, this ability replaces the increase to her channel energy damage normally gained at 5th level&mdash;her channel energy damage increases to 3d6 at 7th level instead, and for the rest of her career as a cleric lags 1d6 behind normal. If the scholar is a wizard, this ability replaces her bonus feat for 5th level.<br /><br />Flash of Insight (Su): At 10th level, once per day, a scroll scholar can gain a +5 bonus on a single attack roll, caster level check, or saving throw as an immediate action. This decision must be made before the results of the roll are known, but can be made after the die is rolled. This ability can be used twice per day at 15th level, and 3 times per day at 20th level. This ability replaces the normal addition of a new 4th-level spell slot to the character&rsquo;s spells per day&mdash; from this point on, the cleric or wizard has one fewer 4thlevel spell slot than other clerics or wizards.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Cleric","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-cross.jpg"}

He can choose any subdomain of those domains offered by an Outer God or Great Old One he worships.<br /><br />This ability alters domains.<br /><br />Forbidden Knowledge (Ex): An Elder Mythos cultist gains a +2 profane bonus on all Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (history), Knowledge (planes), and Knowledge (religion) checks, and can attempt these checks untrained. This bonus doubles if the check is related to the Elder Mythos.<br /><br />Unhinged Mind (Ex): Bartering sanity for unspeakable knowledge, an Elder Mythos cultist props up his crumbling sanity with a darkly enigmatic personality. An Elder Mythos cultist uses Charisma instead of Wisdom as his key spellcasting ability score (to determine his spell DCs, bonus spells per day, bonus on concentration checks, and so on), to determine the effects and umber of uses of his domain powers, and to modify his Will saving throws. However, because of the fragile state of his mind, the Elder Mythos cultist takes a &ndash;2 penalty on Will saves to resist mind-affecting effects. An Elder Mythos cultist automatically fails any save to resist the effects of&nbsp;confusion,&nbsp;insanity, and&nbsp;nightmare, and other similar effects so long as the effect&rsquo;s caster level is higher than his character level.<br /><br />Channel the Void (Su): At 1st level, when an Elder Mythos cultist channels energy, he taps into the unthinkable void between the stars. This is similar to channeling negative energy, but instead of healing undead, this blast of energy harms and devours living beings, corporeal non-skeletal undead, and constructs crafted from flesh (such as flesh golems). This is not negative energy damage; instead, the damage manifests in the form of wounds from supernatural deterioration and rot. A creature that would take damage from this energy can attempt a Fortitude save to halve the damage, rather than a Will save. At 8th level, a creature that both fails the Fortitude save and would be killed or destroyed by this effect is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature&rsquo;s equipment is unaffected. This ability still counts as channel energy, but it counts as neither positive nor negative energy specifically (for example, the Elder Mythos cultist couldn&rsquo;t take the Turn Undead or Command Undead feat). For the purposes of feats that require channel energy but refer to what happens if the character channels positive or negative energy, this ability alters the listed effect for negative energy. For instance, an Elder Mythos cultist could use annel Smite to damage living or fleshy creatures with his melee attack.<br /><br />This ability alters channel energy and replaces spontaneous casting.<br /><br />Maddening Gaze (Su): At 5th level, as a standard action, an Elder Mythos cultist can focus his gaze on a single living creature within 30 feet and inundate the creature&rsquo;s mind with visions of alien horror. The target takes 2 points of Wisdom damage and becomes confused and sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Elder Mythos cultist&rsquo;s cleric level + his Charisma modifier) negates the Wisdom damage and the confusion effect, though the target is sickened for 1 round. This gaze attack is a mind-affecting effect. An Elder Mythos cultist can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus an additional time per day for every 3 cleric levels thereafter.<br /><br />At 11th level, the target takes 1d6+1 points of Wisdom damage and is confused and sickened for 2d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces the Wisdom damage to 1 point, and the target is instead sickened for 1d6 rounds.<br /><br />At 19th level, the target takes 2d6 points of Wisdom damage and is rendered permanently confused and sickened. Only greater restoration, heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish can remove the confused and sickened conditions. A successful Will save halves the Wisdom damage, and the target is instead sickened for 2d6 rounds.<br /><br />This ability replaces the increases to channel energy gained at 5th, 11th, and 19th levels.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Cleric","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-cross.jpg"}

Thus, demon worship is common among the drow, and so are ranks of demonic apostles, who gain magical insight from their dark lords and crush their chaotic masters&rsquo; enemies by channeling demonic energy. A demonic apostle has the following class features.<br /><br />Demonic Magic: A demonic apostle must choose to channel negative energy, and must select either the Chaos or Evil domain or the Demon subdomain as her sole domain.<br /><br />Demonic Familiar: At 1st level, a demonic apostle gains a familiar as a wizard equal to her cleric level, or if she already has a familiar, her cleric levels stack to determine the familiar&rsquo;s abilities. At 3rd level, her familiar gains the fiendish template. At 7th level, the demonic apostle exchanges her familiar for a quasit without the need to take the Improved Familiar feat.<br /><br />Demonic Channel (Su): At 1st level, a demonic apostle can channel demonic energy to damage creatures of lawful and good alignment, or, at higher levels, bolster the abilities of chaotic evil allies.<br /><br />Channeling this energy causes a 30-foot-radius burst centered on the cleric. Creatures within the burst that are lawful or good take 1d6 points of damage, plus 1d6 points of damage for every two levels the cleric possesses beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from the channeled demonic energy receive a Fortitude save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the demonic apostle&rsquo;s level + the demonic apostle&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. Lawful good creatures take a &ndash;2 penalty on this saving throw. At 5th level, chaotic evil allies within the burst are affected as if targeted by a&nbsp;rage&nbsp;spell with a duration of 1 round. At 9th level, lawful or good enemies are also sickened for 1d6 rounds if they fail their saving throw against the demonic channel. Channeling demonic energy is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
