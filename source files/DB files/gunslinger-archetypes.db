But a few rare gunslingers seem to accomplish their chosen tasks purely through willpower and an unwillingness to ever give up. These mysterious strangers use their force of personality to keep going when the chips are down, often moving on from a region as soon as they accomplish their goals&mdash;hence the name. <br /><br />Grit (Ex): A mysterious stranger is a force to be reckoned with. Instead of using her Wisdom to determine the number of grit points she gains at the start of each day, she uses Charisma. This ability works in all other ways like the gunslinger&rsquo;s grit class feature. <br /><br />Deeds: A mysterious stranger swaps a pair of deeds for the following.<br /><br />Focused Aim (Ex): At 1st level, as a swift action, the mysterious stranger can spend 1 grit point to gain a bonus on all firearm damage rolls equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1) with all firearm attacks she makes until the end of her turn. At 7th level, when she uses the dead shot deed, she multiplies this bonus by the number of hits she made while rolling the Dead Shot attack. This deed replaces the quick clear deed.<br /><br />Clipping Shot (Ex): At 11th level, when the mysterious stranger misses with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point to deal half the damage that attack would have dealt if it were a hit (roll damage normally). She can decide to use this deed and spend the grit point after making the attack. This deed has no effect if the attack used the dead shot deed. The cost of using this deed cannot be reduced with the Signature Deed feat, the true grit class feature, or any similar effect. This replaces the bleeding wound deed.<br /><br />Lucky (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a mysterious stranger gains a +1 luck bonus on Will saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). This ability replaces nimble. <br /><br />Stranger&rsquo;s Fortune (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a mysterious stranger can ignore a firearm misfire a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus. She can use this ability as a free action. This ability replaces gun training 1.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Gunslinger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_36.jpg","_id":"1eHCyHUQ0XlnI5kb"}

He has an extraordinary talent for retreating from harm&rsquo;s way and fooling his enemies into thinking he is weaker than he is.<br /><br />Class Skills: A blatherskite gains Escape Artist and Stealth as class skills, but he doesn&rsquo;t gain Handle Animal and Intimidate as class skills.<br /><br />This alters the gunslinger&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Deeds: A blatherskite swaps four deeds for the following.<br /><br />Blatherskite&rsquo;s Stagger (Ex): At 1st level as an immediate action, when a ranged attack would normally miss a blatherskite, he can allow it to hit him and dramatically stagger a few steps backward, moving up to 10 feet directly away from the attacker. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The attack deals the minimum amount of damage (as though the attacker had rolled a natural 1 on each damage die).<br /><br />At 2nd level, if a ranged attack hits the blatherskite but the attack roll exceeds his AC by no more than his bonus from the nimble class feature, he can spend 1 grit point as an immediate action to take the minimum amount of damage and move up to 10 feet directly away from the attacker. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.<br /><br />The gunslinger can perform this deed only while wearing medium or light armor and while carrying no more than a light load.<br /><br />This deed replaces the gunslinger&rsquo;s dodge deed.<br /><br />Blatherskite&rsquo;s Initiative (Ex): At 3rd level, the blatherskite gains benefits as long as he has at least 1 grit point. The blatherskite gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if he is trained in Stealth (and as long as he is not paralyzed, prone, or otherwise immobilized), he can take a 5-foot step and attempt a Stealth check to hide as part of the initiative check, provided there is an object or a larger creature to hide behind; if he spends 1 grit point, he can move up to half his speed instead of taking only a 5-foot step as part of the initiative check.<br /><br />This deed replaces the gunslinger initiative deed.<br /><br />Cheap Shot (Ex): At 3rd level, if the blatherskite has at least 1 grit point and makes a successful attack against an unarmed target with a firearm that is not making a scattering shot, he deals 1d6 additional points of damage. This is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.<br /><br />This deed replaces the pistol-whip deed.<br /><br />Blatherskite&rsquo;s Surprise (Ex): At 7th level, when the blatherskite succeeds at a saving throw against a spell or an effect that would cause him to be blinded, confused, dazed, fascinated, frightened, nauseated, paralyzed, or stunned, he can allow the effect to affect him normally. As long as he has at least 1 grit point, as an immediate action he can cause the creature from which the effect originated to lose its Dexterity bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to half the duration of the effect (in rounds) or half the gunslinger&rsquo;s level, whichever is lower (minimum 1 round). If he instead spends 1 grit point, he does not need to allow the effect to affect him normally to use this deed.<br /><br />This deed replaces the startling shot deed.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Gunslinger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_36.jpg","_id":"5Lv5EMdX5OtPz6vb"}

But some gunslingers want a little more firepower and range. These are the musket masters; the best of these gunslingers can reload a musket with dazzling speed, potentially putting even their pistol-wielding brethren to shame.<br /><br />Weapon Proficiency: Instead of proficiency with all firearms, a musket master only gains proficiency with two-handed firearms. She must take the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearm) feat to gain proficiency with one-handed firearms and firearm siege engines. <br /><br />Gunsmith: A musket master must take a musket when she chooses a battered firearm at 1st level. <br /><br />Deeds: A musket master swaps a pair of deeds for the following.<br /><br />Steady Aim (Ex): At 1st level, as long as a musket master has at least 1 grit point, she can take a move-equivalent action to increase the accuracy of a two-handed firearm. When she does, she increases the range increment of the firearm she is firing by 10 feet. This stacks with other abilities that increase her range increment. This deed replaces the gunslinger&rsquo;s dodge deed. <br /><br />Fast Musket (Ex): At 3rd level, as long as the musket master has 1 grit point, she can reload any two-handed firearm as if it were a one-handed firearm. This deed replaces the utility shot deed. <br /><br />Rapid Reloader: At 1st level, a musket master gains Rapid Reload (muskets) as a bonus feat.<br /><br />Musket Training (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a musket master increases her skill with two-handed firearms. She gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Dexterity modifier, and when she misfires with a two-handed firearm, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4. Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the bonus on damage rolls increases by +1.

The daredevil fighting style of the black powder vaulter has arisen simultaneously in two places&mdash;among Mana Wastes gunslingers inspired by the graceful fighting styles of Mwangi tribes, and among pirates from Tian Xia and the Shackles who encountered and inspired one another.<br /><br />Deeds: A black powder vaulter gains the following deeds.<br /><br />Mobile Reload (Ex): If a black powder vaulter has at least 1 grit point, she can reload a firearm as part of a move action to move, provided that the action to reload that firearm with that type of ammunition would normally take only a move action or swift action. At 3rd level, she can use this deed while also using the shot on the run deed.<br /><br />This deed replaces the deadeye deed. <br /><br />Daring Vault (Ex): A black powder vaulter can spend 1 grit point as a swift action to increase her land speed by 20 feet (gaining the appropriate bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump) until the end of her turn. If the black powder vaulter jumps while affected by this deed, she can make a second jump while midair if she is adjacent to a wall, column, or other solid, permanent structure. The second jump counts as having a running start even if the direction is different from the first jump.<br /><br />This deed replaces the gunslinger&rsquo;s dodge deed. <br /><br />Shot on the Run (Ex): At 3rd level, if the black powder vaulter has at least 1 grit point, she gains the benefits of the <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shot%20on%20the%20Run\">Shot on the Run</a> feat.

Additionally, whenever she is wielding a firearm, she counts as threatening an area around her as though she were wielding a melee weapon.

He can spend 1 grit point when making a scattering shot to automatically miss a number of creatures equal to his Wisdom modifier.<br /><br />This replaces the deadeye deed.<br /><br />Scatter Artist (Ex): At 3rd level, when using a firearm to make a scattering shot, a scatter gunner can spend 1 grit point to add one of the following effects to his attack.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Restricted Barrel: The scattering shot attacks all creatures in a line rather than in a cone. The line&rsquo;s length is twice the length of the weapon&rsquo;s cone (30 feet for most early firearms).</li>\n<li>Shaped Blast: Select one additional square adjacent to the scattering shot&rsquo;s area of effect; creatures in this square are also affected by the scattering shot.</li>\n<li>Vortex: The firearm releases an explosive torrent of air in the scattering shot&rsquo;s affected area for 1 round, creating a strong wind effect (25 mph) that can disperse fog and smoke effects such as those created by fog cloud.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br />This replaces the utility shot deed.<br /><br />Overload (Ex): At 7th level, a scatter gunner knows just how to hold his weapon to maximize its devastating scattering effects. As a full-round action, a scatter gunner can make a scattering shot to fire a concentrated payload of pellets that strains his firearm. This doubles the area affected by the scattering shot (a 30-foot cone for most early firearms), increases the firearm&rsquo;s misfire value by 2, and causes each successful attack to deal an additional 1d6 points of damage that is not multiplied on a critical hit.

This functions like throwing a splash weapon at a grid intersection but uses his firearm&rsquo;s range increment, attack bonus, and magic special abilities (if any). The shell affects creatures in a 10-foot radius as though the scatter gunner had made a scattering shot against them, and damaged creatures must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the scatter gunner&rsquo;s level + the scatter gunner&rsquo;s Dexterity modifier) or catch fire (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444).

A gun scavenger collects scraps, spare parts, and other components that might&mdash;if modified properly&mdash;give her firearm an extra edge.<br /><br />Gunsmith: The gun scavenger&rsquo;s starting weapon is a mishmash of pieces that even other gunpowder enthusiasts fail to comprehend. Anyone other than the gun scavenger treats her starting weapon as broken, even if she uses the Gunsmithing feat (Ultimate Combat 103) to repair it. This ability works in all other ways like the gunslinger&rsquo;s gunsmith class feature.<br /><br />Go By Feel (Ex): A gun scavenger&rsquo;s intuitive and unique style leaves her firearms prone to misfire, whether as a result of using too much powder, using imperfectly milled parts, or any number of other minor inconsistencies. When using a firearm, a gun scavenger cannot reduce that firearm&rsquo;s misfire chance to 0; it can always misfire on a natural 1.<br /><br />Deeds: A gun scavenger gains the following deeds at the listed level.<br /><br />Change Out (Ex): At 1st level, as a full-round action, a gun scavenger can remove the broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. When she does, she can replace the broken part with a specialized, short-lived component that does one of the following: gives the firearm the scatter weapon quality (Ultimate Combat 137); increases the damage dealt by the pistolwhip deed by one die size; or increases the firearm&rsquo;s range increment by 10 feet. A firearm with such a modification increases its misfire chance cumulatively by 1 each time it is fired until it misfires. When it does misfire, the effects of the temporary component are lost. A gun scavenger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gun scavenger spends 1 grit point to perform a change out, she can either perform the change out as a standard action instead of a full-round action, or perform the change out on a firearm that isn&rsquo;t broken. This deed replaces the quick clear deed.<br /><br />Jury-Rig (Ex): At 7th level, as a standard action, a gun scavenger can adjust a firearm she is currently wielding to fire in an unconventional way. She can spend 1 grit point to grant her firearm one of the following magic weapon enhancements for 1 round per gunslinger level: distance, flaming, glameredUE, or thundering. If she spends 2 grit points, she can instead grant the firearm flaming burst or stalkingUE. Multiple uses of this ability don&rsquo;t stack with themselves. This deed replaces the targeting deed.<br /><br />Arbitrary Aim (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a gun scavenger&rsquo;s attacks with firearms are difficult to predict. When shooting a firearm at a creature that has a dodge or insight bonus to its Armor Class, the gun scavenger treats the combined bonus as if it were 1 lower.

These gun tanks trundle into battle with barrels blazing, dealing out punishment with their firearms while knowing few can penetrate their hard protective shells.<br /><br />Armor Proficiency: A gun tank is proficient with all armors and shields, including tower shields. <br /><br />Deeds: A gun tank swaps a pair of deeds for the following. The new deed descriptions include information on which deeds from the gunslinger class feature these new deeds replace.<br /><br />Gun Tank&rsquo;s Resolve (Ex): At 1st level, the gun tank can shrug off the most serious of attacks. When the gun tank is wearing medium or heavy armor and is subject to a critical hit or sneak attack, she can spend 1 grit point as an immediate action to attempt to negate the critical hit or sneak attack damage. At 1st level, she has a 25% chance of doing so. At 10th level, the chance increases to 50%. At 15th level, the chance increases to 75%. While a gun tank&rsquo;s resolve does not stack with the fortification armor special ability, it does work in concert with that armor special ability or similar effects, so a gun tank can use this ability even after the armor of fortification has failed to negate the critical hit or sneak attack damage. This deed replaces the gunslinger&rsquo;s dodge deed.<br /><br />Gun Tank&rsquo;s Resilience (Ex): At 15th level, when the gun tank has at least 1 grit point and makes a successful Fortitude saving throw against an attack that would deal half damage or have a partial effect, she takes no damage or other effects from that attack. Furthermore, she gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects. This deed replaces the evasive deed.<br /><br />Bullet Defection (Ex): A gun tank is adept at modifying and using her armor to stop firearm attacks. Starting at 2nd level, a gun tank wearing medium or heavy armor gains half the armor&rsquo;s bonus plus the armor&rsquo;s enhancement bonus (if any) as a deflection bonus against any non-siege firearm or splash weapon attack (including the alchemist&rsquo;s bomb class ability). This ability has no affect on spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities that make a touch attack. This ability replaces nimble.<br /><br />Armor Training (Ex): At 4th level, a gun tank learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever she is wearing armor, the armor check penalty is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by her armor increases by 1. Every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and 16th), the bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of a &ndash;4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase to the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed. This ability stacks with the fighter class ability of the same name. If the gun tank has both class features, she takes the most advantageous benefit of the two class features. This ability replaces the bonus feats the gunslinger gains at 4th level and every four levels thereafter.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Gunslinger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_36.jpg","_id":"PZH496xWSdIv5ZVy"}

They learn to master the quirks of timeworn technology and methods of keeping weapons charged in a primitive world. Techslingers still start play with the black powder blunderbuss, pistol, or rifle granted by the gunsmith class ability, but they gain specialized powers for use after they gain weapons of advanced technology. A techslinger has the following class features.<br /><br />Deeds: Techslingers have access to all gunslinger deeds, except as noted below for new deeds that replace standard gunslinger deeds.<br /><br />Covet Charge (Ex): At 1st level, a techslinger can spend 1 grit point to use 1 charge fewer than normal when firing a technological weapon (minimum 0), as long as the weapon has enough charges remaining to be fired at least once. This deed replaces deadeye.<br /><br />Reliable (Ex): At 1st level, a techslinger can spend 1 grit point as a free action to prevent a timeworn firearm from glitching. This deed replaces quick clear.<br /><br />Charge Recycling (Ex): At 11th level, by spending 1 grit point, a techslinger can grant 1 temporary charge to a technological firearm, even if the firearm normally can no longer be recharged. This charge must be used within 1 hour or it fades. The techslinger can grant temporary charges to multiple firearms as long as she has enough grit, but temporary charges do not stack with themselves in the same firearm. At 15th level, the techslinger can grant 2 temporary charges when she uses this deed, and at 19th level, she can grant 3 temporary charges. This deed replaces expert loading.<br /><br />Heavy Weaponry Deeds (Ex): At 11th level, as long as the techslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can treat a heavy weapon as a firearm for the purpose of using deeds.<br /><br />Bonus Feats: A techslinger can select Technologist as a bonus feat, even though it&rsquo;s neither a combat nor a grit feat.<br /><br />Technic Training (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a techslinger can select one specific type of advanced technology firearm (such as a laser pistol, mindrender, stun gun, or zero rifle). Thereafter, she gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when using that firearm. Furthermore, she treats all detrimental glitches of timeworn versions of her selected firearm as a result of no glitch. (She can retain the effects of beneficial glitches if she wishes.)<br /><br />Every 4 levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the techslinger selects another type of advanced technology firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.

These gunslingers are called pistoleros. While they lack the flexibility of being able to pick up any kind of firearm and use it with reasonable proficiency, they are crackerjack shots with pistols and similar firearms. Their skill and aim with these firearms at close range is second to none, and they rarely misfire with these weapons.<br /><br />Weapon Proficiency: Instead of proficiency with all firearms, a pistolero only gains proficiency with one-handed firearms. She must take Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearm) to gain proficiency with two-handed firearms and firearm siege engines. <br /><br />Gunsmith: A pistolero must take a pistol when she chooses a battered firearm at 1st level. <br /><br />Deeds: A pistolero swaps a trio of deeds for the following.<br /><br />Up Close and Deadly (Ex): At 1st level, when the pistolero hits a target with a one-handed firearm that is not making a scatter shot, she can spend 1 grit point to deal 1d6 points of extra damage on a hit. If she misses with the attack, she grazes the target, dealing half the extra damage anyway. This is precision damage and is not multiplied if the attack is a critical hit. This precision damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, to 3d6 at 10th level, to 4d6 at 15th level, and to 5d6 at 20th level. This precision damage stacks with sneak attack and other forms of precision damage. The cost of using this deed cannot be reduced with the Signature Deed feat, the true grit class feature, or any similar effect. This deed replaces the deadeye deed.<br /><br />Deadeye (Ex): At 7th level, the pistolero gains the deadeye deed, which is normally a 1st-level gunslinger deed. This deed replaces the startling shot deed. <br /><br />Twin Shot Knockdown (Ex): At 11th level, when the pistolero hits a single target with two or more one-handed firearm attacks during her turn, she can spend 1 grit point to knock the target prone. She can choose to spend the grit point after the attacks are made. This deed replaces the bleeding wound deed.<br /><br />Pistol Training (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a pistolero increases her skill with one-handed firearms. She gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Dexterity modifier, and when she misfires with a one-handed firearm, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4. Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the bonus on damage rolls increases by +1.

They commit their deeds in a more hushed manner, but with just as much flair.<br /><br />Crossbow Maven: A bolt ace is proficient with all crossbows instead of all firearms and begins play with a masterwork crossbow of her choice. This ability alters the gunslinger&rsquo;s weapon proficiencies and replaces gunsmith.<br /><br />Grit (Ex): A bolt ace regains grit when she scores a critical hit or deals a killing blow with any kind of crossbow. This ability modifies the grit class feature.<br /><br />Deeds: A bolt ace can perform the following deeds with a crossbow instead of a firearm: gunslinger initiative, pistol-whip, dead shot, targeting, bleeding wound, death&rsquo;s shot, and stunning shot. The bolt ace swaps the following deeds.<br /><br />Sharp Shoot (Ex): At 1st level, a bolt ace can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing a crossbow at a target within its first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the amount of grit points a deed costs (such as Signature Deed). This deed replaces deadeye.<br /><br />Vigilant Loading (Ex): At 1st level, as long as a bolt ace has at least 1 grit point, she does not provoke attacks of opportunity when loading a crossbow. This deed replaces quick clear.<br /><br />Shooter&rsquo;s Resolve (Ex): At 3rd level, a bolt ace can spend 1 grit point when making a crossbow attack as a standard action and ignore the effects of concealment (though not total concealment) and cover (other than total cover) against that shot. This deed replaces utility shot.<br /><br />Distracting Shot (Ex): At 7th level, a bolt ace can spend 1 grit point and choose to miss a target that she could normally attack within her range with a crossbow attack. When she does, the target loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for 1 round. This deed replaces startling shot.<br /><br />Vigilant Shooter (Ex): At 11th level, as long as a bolt ace spends 1 grit point when she does so, she does not provoke attacks of opportunity when firing a crossbow. This deed replaces expert loading.<br /><br />Inexplicable Reload (Ex): At 11th level, loading a crossbow becomes unthinking and automatic for a bolt ace. As long as she has at least 1 grit point, she always starts each round of combat (even a surprise round) with her crossbow loaded. Also the amount of time needed to reload a crossbow decreases by one step: a standard action becomes a move action, a move action becomes a swift action, a swift action becomes a free action, and a free action becomes not an action. This deed replaces lightning reload.<br /><br />Pinning Shot (Ex): At 15th level, the bolt ace can spend 1 grit point while shooting a crossbow and attempt to pin down its target with the bolt. If the crossbow attack hits, it pins the target to a nearby object, to a wall, or to the ground, entangling and staggering the target. While pinned by the bolt, the target cannot move out of its space until it takes a standard action to free itself from the pinning bolt, except by means of teleportation. This deed replaces menacing shot.<br /><br />Crossbow Training (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a bolt ace can select one specific type of crossbow, such as hand crossbow or heavy crossbow. She gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Dexterity modifier with that crossbow. Furthermore, when she scores a critical hit with that type of crossbow, her critical modifier increases by 1 (a \u001d2 becomes a \u001d3, for example).<br /><br />Every 4 levels thereafter, she can pick a different type of crossbow, gaining the bonus damage and increased critical multiplier with that type of crossbow as well.

For her, gunplay works best when it comes from a concealed position and is directed against a target that falls with the very first volley and is dead before the smoke clears. A bushwhacker has the following class features.<br /><br />Trembling Grit (Ex): At 1st level, at the start of each day, a bushwhacker gains grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier &ndash; 1 (minimum of 1). In addition to all the ways any gunslinger can regain grit, a bushwhacker who reduces a helpless or unaware opponent to 0 hit points or fewer also regains 1 grit point. This expands the way in which the bushwhacker gains grit points, so a bushwhacker who gains grit points in this way only gains 1 grit point for reducing a helpless or unaware opponent, not 2 grit points. This otherwise works like the gunslinger&rsquo;s grit ability and alters that ability.<br /><br />Craven Deeds (Ex): A bushwhacker replaces some of her deeds with the following deeds. This ability otherwise works like the gunslinger&rsquo;s deed ability and alters that ability.<br /><br />Shifty Shot (Ex): At 3rd level, a bushwhacker with at least 1 grit point deals 1d6 points of extra damage when using her firearm to attack opponents denied their Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not). Except for the requirement that she must use a firearm and must have at least 1 grit point to use it, this deed otherwise works identically to a rogue&rsquo;s sneak attack class feature (including the requirement that she must be within 30 feet of her target to deal this extra damage), and stacks with the sneak shot ability (see below) and sneak attack. This deed replaces the utility shot deed.<br /><br />Long Range Shifty Shot (Ex): At 7th level, a bushwhacker can double the range at which she deals extra damage from a sneak attack or shifty shot (from 30 feet to 60 feet) with a firearm by spending 1 grit point. When she spends this grit point, she must still have at least 1 grit point left to deal extra damage from shifty shot if she is using this deed. This deed replaces the targeting deed.<br /><br />Sneak Shot (Ex): At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, a bushwhacker deals 1d6 points of extra damage when using a firearm to attack opponents who are unable to properly defend themselves. Unlike with the shifty shot ability, she deals this extra damage regardless of whether or not she has any grit points when making the attack. Except for the requirement that she makes a firearm attack, this works identically to a rogue&rsquo;s sneak attack class feature. This extra damage stacks with sneak attack and the damage from shifty shot.

Siege gunners specialize in the very largest&mdash; cannons, bombards, and firedrakes. These specialists are rarely seen outside of Alkenstar, however, in part because the duchy keeps close tabs on its most powerful guns and few are found elsewhere in the Inner Sea. A few siege gunners outside of Alkenstar make a living renting out their services and the use of their personal collection of siege weaponry to causes in which they believe or to the highest bidder.<br /><br />Grit (Ex): A siege gunner relies less on luck and intuition and more on cold calculation and wit. The number of grit points a siege gunner gains each day and her maximum grit are based on the siege gunner&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier rather than her Wisdom modifier.<br /><br />Engineer Training (Ex): A siege gunner is trained in all aspects of siegecraft, including the workings of siege engines and knowledge of the structures that are often the target of their assaults. Starting at 2nd level, a siege gunner gains a bonus on Knowledge (engineering) checks equal to 1/2 her gunslinger level. This ability replaces nimble.<br /><br />Deeds: A siege gunner swaps a pair of deeds of her choosing for the following.<br /><br />Targeted Blast (Ex): At 1st level, when using a firearm or siege engine that targets an area rather than a specific creature, the siege gunner can spend 1 grit point to focus the brunt of the blast on a single creature within the target area. The target creature takes 1 additional point of damage for each level the siege gunner possesses. This is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. At 5th level and for every 5 levels the siege gunner possesses beyond that, she can select an additional creature to target with this bonus damage. Targets must be selected before any attack rolls or saving throws are made. This ability replaces deadeye.<br /><br />Scattershot (Ex): At 3rd level, if the siege gunner has at least 1 grit point, she can increase the effectiveness of scattering shots from hand-held firearms and blast shots from siege engines. The cone radius of scattering shots or blast shots increases by 5 feet for every three levels the siege gunner possesses (to a maximum of 30 feet at 18th level). This ability replaces gunslinger initiative.<br /><br />Bonus Feats: At 4th level, a siege gunner gains Siege EngineerUC as a bonus feat. At 8th level, she gains Master Siege EngineerUC as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for these feats. At 12th level and for every 4 levels thereafter, the siege gunner gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These additional bonus feats must be combat or grit feats, and she must meet the prerequisites as normal. This replaces the gunslinger&rsquo;s normal bonus feats.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Gunslinger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_36.jpg","_id":"lmqihX8eb9yRVa8J"}

Firebrands tend to be passionate, devil-may-care wanderers living each day to the fullest.<br /><br />Gunsmith: At 1st level, a firebrand gains a dragon pistol (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 45) as her battered firearm.<br /><br />This ability alters gunsmith.<br /><br />Wild Card (Ex): A firebrand uses her Charisma instead of Wisdom to determine the number of grit points she gains at the start of each day and to determine the DCs of her gunslinger deeds. A firebrand treats direct hits with her bombs as firearm attacks for the purpose of regaining grit (see the bombs ability on page 5). This ability works in all other ways like the gunslinger&rsquo;s grit class feature. This ability alters grit.<br /><br />Deeds: A firebrand gains the following deeds.<br /><br />Dragon Fire (Ex): A firebrand is a master of the volatile substance known as dragon&rsquo;s breath. At 1st level, as a swift action, the firebrand can spend 1 grit point to add her Charisma modifier to the DCs of all dragon&rsquo;s breath cartridges (Ultimate Equipment 42) she fires until the end of her turn. Her attacks with dragon&rsquo;s breath cartridges misfire only if a 1 is rolled on two or more of the damage dice.<br /><br />This deed replaces the deadeye deed.<br /><br />Big Boom! (Su): At 7th level, a firebrand can channel her explosive potential into a mighty blast. As a standard action, the firebrand shoots a 30-foot cone of fire from the barrel of her gun. The firebrand designates one creature in the squares affected by the cone to be the target and makes an attack roll with her firearm against that creature; on a hit, the target takes damage as if it were directly hit by both the firebrand&rsquo;s firearm and her bomb. Creatures in all other squares in the cone (as well as the target&rsquo;s square, if the gunslinger&rsquo;s attack missed) take splash damage as if they were in the area of the firebrand&rsquo;s bomb, with a Reflex saving throw for half damage. (The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + half the firebrand&rsquo;s gunslinger level + the firebrand&rsquo;s Charisma modifier.) Using this deed costs 2 grit points and expends one of the firebrand&rsquo;s daily uses of bombs (see the bombs ability on page 5), as well as the appropriate ammunition for the firearm attack; ammunition that does not require an attack roll cannot be used this way.<br /><br />This deed replaces the dead shot deed.<br /><br />Scorched Earth (Ex): The firebrand knows how to make dragon&rsquo;s breath burn white-hot. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the fire damage of the first dragon&rsquo;s breath cartridge fired by the firebrand each round increases by 1d6 (to a maximum total of 7d6 at 20th level).<br /><br />This ability replaces the gunslinger&rsquo;s bonus feats gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th levels.<br /><br />Bombs (Su): At 5th level, the firebrand gains the bombs ability as an alchemist of her gunslinger level &ndash; 4, using her Charisma modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier to determine her number of bombs per day and the DC to avoid splash damage. The firebrand adds her Charisma modifier to her bombs&rsquo; damage instead of her Intelligence modifier, even if she has the throw anything class feature. In addition, the firebrand&rsquo;s bombs are always under the effect of the explosive bombs discovery. Firebrand levels do not stack with levels in other classes with the bombs class feature.<br /><br />This ability replaces gun training.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Gunslinger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_36.jpg","_id":"mo7OgruRpYvkumJF"}

Their exploits are fueled by the thrill of danger and often by the temporary courage provided by grog. A buccaneer has the following class features.<br /><br />Deeds: A buccaneer swaps four of the normal gunslinger deeds for the following deeds.<br /><br />Seadog&rsquo;s Gait (Ex): At 1st level, the buccaneer gains Sea Legs as a bonus feat. If she spends 1 grit point, she can ignore difficult terrain until the end of her turn. This replaces the quick clear deed.<br /><br />Pirate&rsquo;s Jargon (Ex): At 3rd level, the buccaneer&rsquo;s baffling palaver of nautical jargon and piratical cant provides a +2 bonus on Bluff and Intimidate checks. Furthermore, she can spend a swift action and 1 grit point to cause a single living creature within 30 feet to make a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 her buccaneer level + her Charisma modifier) or become confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting language-dependent effect. This replaces the pistol whip deed.<br /><br />Rope Swing (Ex): At 7th level, as long as the buccaneer has at least 1 grit point, she gains a bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks equal to her gunslinger level when climbing or swinging on a rope. If she spends 1 grit point, her move while climbing or swinging on a rope does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This replaces the dead shot deed.<br /><br />Captain&rsquo;s Curse (Sp): At 11th level, a buccaneer can spend 2 grit points to use old salt&rsquo;s curse as a spell-like ability. At 15th level, she may use black mark instead. The caster level for these spell-like abilities is equal to the buccaneer&rsquo;s class level, and the save DC is equal to 10 + her buccaneer level + her Charisma modifier. This replaces the lightning reload deed.<br /><br />Grit (Ex): Like the sea itself, a buccaneer is a force of nature. Instead of using her Wisdom modifier to determine the number of grit points she gains at the start of each day, she uses her Charisma modifier. This ability works in all other ways like the gunslinger&rsquo;s grit class feature.<br /><br />Liquid Courage (Ex): At 2nd level, a buccaneer gains the ability to fortify her grit with strong drink. The act of drinking is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and each drink provides 1 grog point. Grog points can be used in place of grit points to fuel deeds or grit feats (including those requiring a minimum of 1 grit point to use). The buccaneer can gain a maximum number of grog points each day equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1), and they last for 1 hour or until used, whichever comes first. She gains a morale bonus on saves against fear and a dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity equal to her current grog point total. This ability replaces the nimble ability.<br /><br />Bonus Feat: In addition to combat and grit feats, a buccaneer can select from the following feats as her bonus feats: Expert Driver (water vehicles only), Master Siege Engineer, Siege Engineer, Siege Gunner, Skilled Driver (water vehicles only).<br /><br />Exotic Pet (Ex): At 5th level, a buccaneer gains a familiar as a wizard of half the buccaneer&rsquo;s class level (though the exotic pet never gains the ability to deliver touch spells or share spells). This pet is typically a monkey or parrot (use the stats for a raven familiar). Such animals are useful scouts, even in the thick of combat. As long as the pet is within 30 feet of the buccaneer, the buccaneer also gains the benefit of evasion. This ability replaces gun training 1.<br /><br />Sword and Pistol: At 9th level, a buccaneer gains Sword and Pistol as a bonus feat even if she does not meet the prerequisites. This ability replaces gun training 2.<br /><br />Gun Training (Ex): A buccaneer gains this ability only at 13th level with a single type of firearm.<br /><br />Raider&rsquo;s Riposte (Ex): At 17th level, whenever an enemy misses a buccaneer with an attack of opportunity, it provokes an attack of opportunity from the buccaneer.

{"name":"Gunslinger (Experimental Gunsmith)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advanced Race Guide pg. 34</a><br />The experimental gunsmith is obsessed with creating the ultimate firearm, and is willing to take risks to work the kinks out of her design. An experimental gunsmith has the following class features.<br /><br />Experimental Firearm (Ex): At 1st level, an experimental gunsmith begins play with an experimental firearm. This acts as the gunslinger&rsquo;s gunsmith ability, but the firearm the experimental gunsmith begins with has one innovation (see below). Further, the experimental gunsmith is treated as having the Gunsmithing feat, but only in regard to his beginning firearm (or the construction of a replacement firearm of the same design, if the original is lost). This ability otherwise works like the standard gunslinger&rsquo;s gunsmith and Gunsmithing abilities and replaces those abilities.<br /><br />Innovations (Ex): An experimental gunsmith starts play with one innovation she can make to her experimental firearms, selected from the list below. This innovation is a radical change to the typical design of a firearm, and comes with both additional benefits and noteworthy drawbacks. The experimental gunsmith can maintain only one experimental firearm modified with one or more innovations, as it requires constant adjustments and much of her time is spent maintaining the weapon. If the experimental gunsmith takes the Gunsmithing feat, she can create other firearms using a single innovation she knows (or add one innovation to an existing firearm), though such weapons become unreliable over time. The misfire value of such weapons increases by 1 for each week after its creation, although the experimental gunsmith can return the misfire rate to normal by spending 1 day maintaining the weapon and spending 50 gp in raw materials. For the purposes of crafting such firearms, each innovation is treated as the masterwork weapon quality (with a value of 300 gp). <br /><br />At 5th level, and every four levels after that (9th, 13th, and 17th level), the experimental gunsmith learns one additional innovation from the list below. These represent constant and increasingly skilled tinkering with a single firearm in her possession, and when the experimental gunsmith gains an innovation, she may immediately apply it to her experimental firearm. Once an innovation has been selected, it cannot be changed. This ability replaces gun training. <br /><br />Expanded Capacity: The experimental gunsmith increases her firearm&rsquo;s capacity by one (generally by adding another barrel, depending on the weapon&rsquo;s design). She also increases its weight by 50%. Because of the complexity of increasing its capacity, her weapon is more prone to misfire, and its misfire value increases by 1 (this is in addition to any misfire increase if the weapon is made with the Gunsmithing feat). <br /><br />Expanded Chamber: The experimental gunsmith&rsquo;s firearm has a much larger than normal chamber for black powder, allowing her to use 2 doses of powder with each shot. The weapon grants a +1 circumstance bonus on damage rolls. However, when the weapon misfires, it causes a flashburn. This is the same as the weapon exploding (dealing damage from a corner of the experimental gunsmith&rsquo;s square), except the weapon is not automatically destroyed. If a broken weapon misfires, it is destroyed as normal. <br /><br />Grapple Launcher: The experimental gunsmith&rsquo;s firearm includes a special set of rails that allows her to slide a grappling hook over the barrel and fire it as a full-round action. The grappling hook anchors into anything she successfully hits with an attack roll, and the DC of the Strength check required to pull the grappling hook loose is equal to her attack roll to lodge it in place. A Disable Device check can remove it with a +5 bonus on the check, and a creature struck by the hook can escape it with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check with a +5 bonus on the check. The firearm is powerful enough to fire a hook trailing up to 100 feet of rope, but throws off the balance of the experimental gunsmith&rsquo;s firearm, reducing its range increment by 50%. <br /><br />Recoilless: The experimental gunsmith&rsquo;s firearm includes a series of gears, springs, and pistons designed to reduce its recoil and thus improve accuracy. The range increment of the weapon increases by 10 feet. However, the system is fragile, and easily damaged. Anytime the weapon misfires, this system becomes broken and does not function until the experimental gunsmith spends 1 hour repairing it. <br /><br />Vial Launcher: The experimental gunsmith adds a special tube onto her firearm that can hold 1 vial of alchemical material, such as alchemist&rsquo;s fire, a tanglefoot bag, or a thunderstone. A special trigger allows her to channel the force of black powder into this tube to launch the vial as a ranged attack with half the range increment of her firearm. The experimental gunsmith can take this action in place of any single ranged attack, and may use the same attack bonus that she can apply to the firearm. If the alchemical substance has a save DC, it becomes 10 + 1/2 her experimental gunsmith level + her Wisdom modifier when she launches the vial from her firearm. This increase only applies to the initial saving throw. If additional saving throws are called for, they are resolved as normal. Reloading the tube is a time-consuming process and requires two full-round actions. If the weapon misfires while loaded with an alchemical substance, it detonates with the experimental gunsmith (and the firearm) as the target.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Gunslinger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_36.jpg","_id":"nYVPk5jea0K89u3M"}

Since these battlegrounds often have tight corners and few areas with long lines of sight, those ratfolk who seek to master the use of firearms almost inevitably become experts in close-quarters combat. These gulch gunners often specialize in proficiency with a single pistol (easily handled in tight spaces) and wander from warren to warren selling their tunnel-shooting skills to the highest bidder. A gulch gunner has the following class features.<br /><br />Class Skills: A gulch gunner adds Disable Device, Escape Artist, and Knowledge (dungeoneering) to her list of class skills and removes Knowledge (local), Ride, and Swim from her list of class skills.<br /><br />Grit (Ex): At 1st level, a gulch gunner gains grit as a standard gunslinger. However, the close-combat focus of the gulch gunner results in a slightly different set of circumstances for regaining grit. <br /><br />Daring Adjacent Shot: The first time each round the gulch gunner makes a ranged firearm attack against an adjacent foe and provokes an attack of opportunity, she regains 1 grit point. Making an adjacent firearm attack against a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gulch gunner&rsquo;s character level does not restore grit, nor do ranged attacks using some ability that prevents the gulch gunner from provoking an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces the ability to regain grit from a critical hit with a firearm.<br /><br />Deeds: A gulch gunner has some unique deeds, which replace some of the standard gunslinger deeds as listed in each entry. These deeds follow all the general rules and restrictions of gunslinger deeds. <br /><br />Flash and Shock (Ex): At 1st level, the gulch gunner can take advantage of the flash and sound of a firearm to throw off an attacker&rsquo;s aim at close range. When she makes an attack against a foe within her firearm&rsquo;s first range increment, she may spend 1 grit point to gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against that opponent until the beginning of her next turn. She can only perform this deed while wearing medium, light, or no armor, and while carrying no more than a light load. This deed replaces the deadeye deed. <br /><br />Powder Burns (Ex): At 3rd level, the gulch gunner learns to maximize the damage dealt by a firearm at extremely close range. When the gulch gunner successfully hits an adjacent foe with a ranged firearm attack, she may spend 1 grit point to deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage from the muzzle flash of her weapon. The target must also make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the gulch gunner&rsquo;s level + the gulch gunner&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier) or catch on fire. This deed replaces the pistol whip deed. <br /><br />Staggering Shot (Ex): At 15th level, when the gulch gunner hits an adjacent target with a ranged firearm attack, the target must also make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the gulch gunner&rsquo;s level + the gulch gunner&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier) or be staggered for 1d4 rounds. This deed replaces the menacing shot deed.<br /><br />Belly Shot (Ex): At 9th level, a gulch gunner can press her firearm directly against a vulnerable location of an adjacent target, dealing additional damage. When the gulch gunner successfully hits an adjacent target with a ranged firearm attack, she deals +1d6 points of damage. This damage increases to +2d6 at 13th level and to +3d6 at 17th level. Creatures immune to precision damage, critical hits, or sneak attacks do not take this additional damage.

During the knight&rsquo;s next turn, if he makes a ranged attack against the pinpointed target and would take a penalty on his attack roll due to range, he may reduce this penalty by an amount equal to his gunner squire&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier (to a minimum penalty of 0). The gunner squire must be adjacent to her liege and able to communicate to use this deed, though a knight may move away from the gunner squire during his turn and still gain the benefits of this deed. This deed replaces the gunslinger&rsquo;s dodge deed. <br /><br />Side Arm (Ex): At 3rd level, as a full-round action, a gunner squire can spend 1 grit point to reload a one-handed or two-handed firearm she is holding. If the firearm has multiple barrels, she can reload a number of barrels per round equal to her Dexterity modifier (minimum 1). A gunner squire equipped with alchemical cartridges (see Ultimate Equipment) can use this deed to reload multiple firearms at once, dividing the number of barrels she&rsquo;s able to reload among the firearms she is carrying however she wishes, even if this would mean stowing and retrieving multiple firearms from her equipment with one action. Abilities, deeds, and feats that decrease reloading time (such as Rapid Reload) do not improve this deed. This deed replaces gunslinger initiative.<br /><br />Safe Handling (Ex): At 2nd level, as a full-round action, a gunner squire can temporarily ensure the safety of a firearm she is holding, reducing its misfire chance by 1 (to a minimum of 0) on the next attack roll made with that firearm. This reduction does not stack with itself. This reduction occurs after any increases are calculated for firing with the broken condition, or for any other effect that might increase the misfire value of a firearm.

She can do this after she rolls the check but before the result is revealed. If the result of the d6 roll is a natural 6, she rolls another 1d6 and adds it to the check.

First employed in the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, they are now also found in the jungle courts of the Mwangi Expanse, the lesser chambers of Nex&rsquo;s Council of Three and Nine, and the Hurricane King&rsquo;s gatherings in the Shackles.<br /><br />Class Skills: A thronewarden adds Sense Motive to her list of class skills, instead of Bluff.<br /><br />This alters the gunslinger&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Hair-Trigger Reflexes (Ex): At 2nd level, as long as she has at least 1 grit point, a thronewarden can act in a surprise round even if she doesn&rsquo;t notice her enemies, though she remains flat-footed until she acts. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on initiative checks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 gunslinger levels beyond 2nd. Finally, at 10th level, she can spend 1 grit point to take both a standard action and a move action (or a full-round action) during the surprise round.<br /><br />This ability replaces nimble.<br /><br />Eye for Trouble (Ex): At 4th level, a thronewarden can spend 1 grit point when she attempts a Perception or Sense Motive check to roll 1d6 and add the result to the check.

The creature is staggered on its next turn. If a thronewarden uses this ability in a surprise round on a creature that has not yet acted, that creature instead loses its surprise-round action if it has one.<br /><br />This deed replaces startling shot.<br /><br />Opening Shot (Ex): At 11th level as a standard action, a thronewarden can call her allies to action in a surprise round by spending 1 grit point and shooting a firearm into the air. Any allies within 30 feet who would not normally be able to act in the surprise round can act at the end of the surprise round (their order is determined by their initiative results; they act in normal initiative order in following rounds). Allies who would normally act in the surprise round but who have not yet acted can take a full round&rsquo;s worth of actions instead of just a move or standard action.<br /><br />This deed replaces bleeding wound.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Gunslinger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_36.jpg","_id":"wPYpk9sInRu072AT"}

The following are class features for wyrm snipers.<br /><br />Class Skills: A wyrm sniper adds Knowledge (arcana) to her list of class skills, in addition to the normal gunslinger class skills.<br /><br />Artillery Proficiency: Wyrm snipers are proficient with light siege engines, in addition to the normal gunslinger weapon proficiencies. See page 26 of this book for new anti-dragon siege weaponry.<br /><br />Deeds: A wyrm sniper swaps a trio of deeds for the following deeds. <br /><br />Munitions Master: At 7th level, a wyrm sniper can spend 1 grit point to reduce the number of full-round actions (or move actions, if the sniper has the Master Siege Engineer feat) required to load a light siege engine by 1. This deed replaces the gunslinger&rsquo;s startling shot deed. <br /><br />Skeleton Crew: At 11th level, as long as a wyrm sniper has at least 1 grit point, she treats all light siege engines as requiring a crew of one fewer than normal to operate (minimum 1). This deed replaces the gunslinger&rsquo;s lightning reload deed. <br /><br />Anti-Air Targeting: At 15th level, whenever a wyrm sniper targets a creature&rsquo;s wings with the targeting deed, the wyrm sniper completely disables one of the creature&rsquo;s wings on a successful hit. If the wyrm sniper hits her target, the creature falls to the ground, regardless of its altitude, taking the appropriate amount of falling damage as a result. As long as the target has at least one functioning wing, it may attempt a DC 20 Fly check to gain the benefits of feather fall instead of plummeting to the ground. In either case, it must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the wyrm sniper&rsquo;s level + the wyrm sniper&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier) or fall prone when reaching the ground. This ability replaces the gunslinger&rsquo;s menacing shot deed.<br /><br />Siege Commander (Ex): At 4th level, a wyrm sniper may select the Siege Commander combat feat as her bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.<br /><br />Heavy Gunner (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a wyrm sniper may select one specific type of light siege weapon (such as a ballista or light bombard) in place of a specific type of firearm as part of her gun training class ability. Every 4 levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), when she can pick a new type of firearm for the gun training class ability, the gunslinger may again select another type of light siege engine.<br /><br />Master Siege Engineer (Ex): At 12th level, a wyrm sniper may select the Master Siege Engineer combat feat as her bonus feat, even if she does not meet the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Gunslinger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_36.jpg","_id":"xZXZp3AqiQQUtwHq"}
