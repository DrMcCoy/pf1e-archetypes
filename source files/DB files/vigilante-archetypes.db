The hidden current operates above and below the sea. When operating underwater, he blends easily with the locals, passing himself off as one of them or as an experienced aquatic traveler. When operating on land, he erases all traces of his aquatic heritage. When the hidden current needs to avoid pursuit, he slips away into his native environment.<br /><br />Guise of the Land Walker (Ex): At 1st level, a hidden current gains the many guises social talent, but the mundane identity assumed must be of a nonaquatic humanoid and functions only when he is on land.<br /><br />This ability replaces the hidden current&rsquo;s 1st-level social talent.<br /><br />Sea&rsquo;s Return (Sp): At 11th level, a hidden current can magically slip between the sea and the land, as if using the spell dimension door with a caster level equal to the hidden current&rsquo;s vigilante level. The starting point of this ability must be on land and the ending point in water at least waist deep, or vice versa. Using this ability is a move action. The hidden current cannot take other creatures with him when he uses this ability.

Imperial agents are often the descendants of nobility and generals from Lung Wa, devoted to reuniting the empire by conquering Lung Wa&rsquo;s successor states. Often forming secret networks with fanciful names, they focus on destabilizing nations with blackmail, slander, and treachery.<br /><br />Slander (Ex): At 1st level, an imperial agent becomes an expert at spreading malicious rumors in order to foment chaos and strife to further his aims. Slandering an individual or organization takes 1d4 days in a settlement smaller than a town, or 1 week in a town or larger settlement. The imperial agent must succeed at either a Bluff or Diplomacy check. If the general populace is indifferent towards the target of the slander, the DC of this check is 20 + the target&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. For each step above indifferent the public&rsquo;s attitude towards the target is, the DC increases by 5, and for each step below indifferent the public&rsquo;s attitude towards the target is, the DC decreases by 5. If the imperial agent is successful, the public&rsquo;s attitude toward his target is decreased by 1 step. If the imperial agent fails the check, however, he cannot affect the settlement with this ability for 1 week, and the target of his slander becomes aware that someone is spreading malicious rumors. The GM determines the exact effects of the public&rsquo;s shift in attitude. Even if the public is hostile toward the target, they might not act openly against the target, especially if doing so might be dangerous.<br /><br />This replaces the social talent gained at 1st level.<br /><br />Manipulative (Ex): At 3rd level, an imperial agent is a master of blackmail, extortion, and subterfuge. He gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his vigilante level on Bluff checks (except those to feint) and on Intimidate checks (except those to demoralize an opponent).<br /><br />This replaces unshakable.<br /><br />False Flag (Ex): At 5th level, whenever an imperial agent changes his identity, he has a third option (instead of social or vigilante) he can wear a false flag. This functions identically to the many guises social talent, except that the false flag identity is associated with a particular nation, organization, or other faction. The imperial agent gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate a member of that faction against creatures who are unaffiliated with that faction, potentially allowing the imperial agent to pin the blame for his actions on the faction he was impersonating. However, the imperial agent receives no bonus and a &ndash;10 penalty on Disguise checks against members of the faction he is impersonating. An imperial agent can choose a different faction each time he uses this ability. Factions that lack a flag, uniform, or other symbol of membership may be difficult or impossible to impersonate, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.<br /><br />This replaces the social talent gained at 5th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"2sBPGaty9BzmNGb9"}

Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful descriptors in their spell descriptions.<br /><br />Alignment: A zealot&rsquo;s alignment must be within one step of his deity&rsquo;s, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis, but only when in his vigilante identity. If his social identity&rsquo;s alignment isn&rsquo;t within one step of his deity&rsquo;s, he can&rsquo;t cast spells in his social identity.<br /><br />Aura (Ex): A zealot of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity&rsquo;s alignment (see detect evil spell for details), but only when in his vigilante identity.<br /><br />Inquisition (Ex): A zealot picks a deity and picks a single inquisition (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 41) tied to that deity. He uses his vigilante level as his inquisitor level to determine level dependent inquisition abilities.<br /><br />This ability replaces vigilante specialization.<br /><br />Zealot Talents: A zealot can select from any of the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents. This alters vigilante talents.<br /><br />Channel Energy (Su): A zealot who takes this talent can channel energy with an effective cleric level equal to his vigilante level &ndash; 4 (minimum 1) while in his vigilante identity. If good in his vigilante identity (or if he worships a good deity), the vigilante channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures. If evil in his vigilante identity (or if he worships an evil deity), the vigilante channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. If the vigilante is neutral in his vigilante identity and worships a neutral deity, the vigilante must choose whether he channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it can&rsquo;t be reversed.<br /><br />Discern Lies (Sp): The zealot can use discern lies as a spell-like ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his vigilante level. The rounds need not be consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action. A zealot must be 6th level before taking this talent.<br /><br />Empower Symbol (Su): As a standard action, the zealot can empower his holy symbol. If the zealot is of good alignment while in his vigilante identity (or worships a good deity), this works as if the holy symbol was the center of a consecrate effect. If the zealot is of evil alignment in his vigilante identity (or worships an evil deity), this works as if the holy symbol was the center of a desecrate effect. If the zealot is neutral in his vigilante identity and worships a neutral deity, he can choose whether this ability acts as per consecrate or desecrate, but once the choice is made, it cannot be changed. At 10th level, the zealot treats his holy symbol as a permanent fixture for the purpose of determining the consecration or desecration effects. A zealot must be at least 6th level to select this talent.<br /><br />Stalwart (Ex): A zealot with this talent can use mental and physical resilience to avoid certain attacks. If he succeeds at a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he avoids the effect entirely. A helpless zealot doesn&rsquo;t gain the benefit of this ability. A zealot must be 12th level before selecting this talent.<br /><br />Stern Gaze (Ex): A zealot with this talent is skilled at sensing deception and intimidating his foes. The zealot gains a morale bonus on all Intimidate and Sense Motive checks equal to half his vigilante level (minimum +1).<br /><br />Zealot Smite (Su): Once per day, a zealot with this talent can use this power to smite a foe. Zealots that are good in their vigilante identity (or worship a good deity) can smite evil creatures, those that are evil in their vigilante identity (or worship an evil deity) can smite good creatures, those that are chaotic in their vigilante identity (or worship a chaotic deity) can smite lawful creatures, and those that are lawful in their vigilante identity (or worship a lawful deity) can smite chaotic creatures. A zealot that is neutral when in his vigilante identity and that worships a neutral deity can pick to smite any one of the four alignments; other zealots must select from the alignments available based on their own alignment or their deity&rsquo;s. Once that choice is made, it can&rsquo;t be changed.<br /><br />As a swift action, the zealot chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is of the proper alignment, the zealot adds his Charisma bonus on his attack rolls (to a maximum of half his vigilante level) and his vigilante level on all damage rolls against the target of his smite. If the target of smite is an outsider with an alignment subtype of the zealot&rsquo;s smite, a similarly aligned dragon, or an undead creature (if the zealot&rsquo;s smite is against evil creatures), a good-aligned cleric or paladin (if the zealot&rsquo;s smite is against good creatures), a chaotic aberration (if the zealot&rsquo;s smite is against chaotic creatures), or a lawful-aligned cleric or paladin (if the zealot&rsquo;s smite is against lawful creatures), the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per vigilante level. Regardless of the target, the zealot&rsquo;s smite attacks bypass the creature&rsquo;s DR as if it were a weapon with a +5 enhancement bonus.<br /><br />At 5th level, and every 3 vigilante levels thereafter, a zealot can smite one additional time per day, to a maximum of seven times per day at 20th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"7Kpq8LUzBtdEP0g4"}

They keep these wondrous abilities secret, though they are aided in their endeavors by creatures just as magical as they are.<br /><br />Class Skills: A magical child adds Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (planes), and Spellcraft to her list of class skills, instead of Disable Device, Knowledge (engineering), Perception, and Survival.<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Skill Ranks per Level: A magical child gains a number of skill ranks equal to 4 + her Intelligence modifier at each level, instead of the normal 6 + her Intelligence modifier skill ranks.<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s skill ranks per level.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: A magical child is not proficient with medium armor. She can cast summoner spells (see spellcasting below) while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance.<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s armor and weapon proficiencies.<br /><br />Spellcasting: A magical child casts arcane spells and cantrips as an unchained summoner. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell&rsquo;s level, and she chooses her spells known from the summoner spell list (she cannot choose spells that would affect an eidolon). A magical child&rsquo;s selection of spells is extremely limited; use Table 1&ndash;5: Summoner Spells Known on page 27 of Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained to determine how many spells the magical child knows at each level. A magical child needs to commune with her animal guide for 1 hour in order to replenish her daily spell slots.<br /><br />This replaces the 4th-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 16th-level vigilante talents.<br /><br />Transformation Sequence (Su): A magical child&rsquo;s transformation between identities is assisted by magic. This makes it faster than usual, but also more noticeable. A magical child can normally transform between her identities in 5 rounds, though this improves to a standard action with the quick change social talent and a swift action with the immediate change social talent. However, the transformation is quite a spectacle, involving loud sounds or music, brilliant colorful energies, and swift motions.<br /><br />Animal Guide (Ex): A magical child starts play with a magical spirit guide in the form of a familiar, using her vigilante level as her effective wizard level. The familiar also has a social identity as a seemingly normal animal, though vigilantes with outlandish familiars might still need to hide the familiar.<br /><br />At 3rd level, the magical child&rsquo;s familiar reveals another aspect of its form, and its vigilante identity changes into a creature on the Improved Familiar list that would be available to a 3rd-level spellcaster (the animal guide&rsquo;s social identity always remains as the original normal animal). The familiar can change its vigilante identity again when the magical child reaches 5th and 7th level, each time to familiars available at those levels. The Improved Familiar feat&rsquo;s alignment restrictions apply to this ability, but only the magical child&rsquo;s vigilante identity needs to have an alignment that fulfills the alignment requirements of the improved familiar. The familiar&rsquo;s new vigilante form choices are permanent, and it cannot transform back into its former vigilante identities until 9th level, when the familiar gains the change shape universal monster ability if it doesn&rsquo;t already have it. It can use this ability at will when in its vigilante identity to transform into any of its four vigilante identities. In vigilante form, a magical child&rsquo;s familiar gains an amount of DR/magic equal to her vigilante level. This doesn&rsquo;t stack with any DR/magic that her vigilante form might already possess.<br /><br />If a magical child&rsquo;s familiar dies, its consciousness simply leaves its body, and the magical child can replace its body after 24 hours. To do so, she must conduct an 8-hour ritual that costs 200 gp per her vigilante level, but once the ritual is complete, the familiar returns in a new body. It retains all of its memories from its earlier service to the magical child.<br /><br />This ability replaces vigilante specialization.<br /><br />Staunch Ally (Ex): A magical child&rsquo;s familiar counts as the magical child for purposes of the startling appearance, frightening appearance, and stunning appearance abilities, and it can calculate its DCs using either its own Charisma modifier or the magical child&rsquo;s, whichever is better. At 20th level, the familiar can make vengeance strikes as if it were the magical child.<br /><br />This ability alters startling appearance, frightening appearance, stunning appearance, and vengeance strike.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"8PU9lKfU9V4Y9IO0"}

Psychometrists aren&rsquo;t spellcasters; instead, they collect strange items or create their own uncanny gadgets that seem to only work for them. Psychometrists often hide their clandestine activities behind the guise of an eccentric peddler, curator, tinker, or artificer.<br /><br />Class Skills: A psychometrist adds Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) to his list of class skills, instead of Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Knowledge (engineering).<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Occult Awareness: At 1st level, a psychometrist gains Psychic Sensitivity (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 138) as a bonus feat.<br /><br />This ability replaces the social talent gained at 1st level.<br /><br />Implements and Focus Powers (Su): At 2nd level, a psychometrist learns to use the powers of one implement school from the occultist class (Occult Adventures 47); the conjuration implement school is not available to a psychometrist. This implement school does not allow the psychometrist to cast any spells of that school of magic, though, and he can&rsquo;t use spell-trigger or spell-completion magic items from any schools without succeeding at the appropriate Use Magic Device check. A psychometrist can&rsquo;t select an implement school more than once. The psychometrist treats his vigilante level as his occultist level for purposes of determining how his implements&rsquo; focus powers work, and for determining at what level he may choose certain focus powers. Unlike an occultist, each of a psychometrist&rsquo;s focus powers has its own associated implement or gadget. For example, a psychometrist might own a scabbard implement to use the legacy weapon focus power and an implement that is a pair of boots to use the sudden speed focus power. The psychometrist must assign mental focus separately to each implement each day, and he doesn&rsquo;t gain resonant powers his implements. Otherwise, this ability acts like the occultist&rsquo;s implements class feature. At 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, the psychometrist learns to use one additional implement school.<br /><br />Each time a psychometrist learns an implement school, he learns the base focus power from that school, plus one focus power from each implement school he has previously learned (but not from the new school he just learned). The psychometrist can use focus powers only by expending mental focus (see below). Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throw against a focus power equals 10 + 1/2 the psychometrist&rsquo;s vigilante level + the psychometrist&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier. The psychometrist can select a school he already knows, and in this case, he gains a total of two new focus powers from that school (instead of learning the base focus power from the new school).<br /><br />This replaces the vigilante talents gained at 2nd, 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.<br /><br />Mental Focus (Su): At 2nd level, like an occultist, a psychometrist has mental focus he can invest into his implements each day to allow him to utilize abilities tied to them. A psychometrist has a number of points of mental focus equal to half his vigilante level plus his Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />Object Reading (Su): At 2nd level, a psychometrist can read information from items he examines, and gains the occultist&rsquo;s object reading ability (Occult Adventures 48).<br /><br />This ability replaces unshakable.<br /><br />Psychometric Strike (Su): At 20th level, a psychometrist gains twice the usual benefits of vengeance strike (up to the same maximum) against an opponent who possesses an object that once belonged to the psychometrist.<br /><br />This ability alters vengeance strike.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"CIz7bFL8NyIbOeZQ"}

Practice with blood sacrifices, necromancy, and shadow magic gives a cabalist a reputation as a sinister and dangerous vigilante.<br /><br />Class Skills: The cabalist adds Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft to his list of class skills, instead of Disable Device, Knowledge (engineering), Perception, and Survival.<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Skill Ranks per Level: The cabalist gains a number of skill ranks equal to 4 + his Intelligence modifier at each level, instead of 6 + his Intelligence modifier skill ranks.<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s skill ranks per level.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: A cabalist is not proficient with medium armor. Like a magus, he can cast cabalist spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance.<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s armor and weapon proficiencies.<br /><br />Spellcasting: A cabalist casts arcane spells and cantrips as a magus. He prepares spells using a spellbook, choosing them from the 6th-level and lower spells from the witch spell list; higher-level witch spells are not on the cabalist&rsquo;s spell list.<br /><br />This replaces the 4th-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 16th-level vigilante talents. <br /><br />Spellbook : A cabalist has a spellbook that functions in the same way as a magus&rsquo;s spellbook but uses the 6th-level and lower spells from the witch spell list.<br /><br />Spill Blood (Ex): A cabalist can cause bleeding when he deals piercing or slashing damage with a melee attack (or a ranged attack within 30 feet) against a living foe who is unaware of his presence, who considers him an ally, or who is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. The amount of bleed damage is equal to the cabalist&rsquo;s level. A cabalist can&rsquo;t deal this bleed damage to a creature with total concealment.<br /><br />This ability replaces vigilante specialization.<br /><br />Cabalist Talents: A cabalist can select from the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents. This alters vigilante talents.<br /><br />Bond of Blood (Sp, Su): The cabalist has a magical bond to life-giving blood. When the cabalist deals bleed damage or 5 or more points of piercing or slashing damage to an adjacent living creature, he gains 1d6 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour, and the cabalist can&rsquo;t gain temporary hit points again from bond of blood during that hour (even if he loses all the temporary hit points from bond of blood before that time). The number of temporary hit points gained increases by 1d6 for every 4 vigilante levels he has. At 4th level, the cabalist can also activate blood armorACG once per day as a spell-like ability as a swift action.<br /><br />Familiar (Ex): The cabalist gains a familiar, using his vigilante level as his effective wizard level. The familiar also has a social identity as a seemingly normal animal, though cabalists with outlandish familiars might still need to hide them.<br /><br />Living Shadow (Sp): Once per day, the cabalist can become a living shadow as though he were using shadow bodyOA. This effect lasts for 1 round per vigilante level, and the cabalist can&rsquo;t cast spells while in this form. At 14th level, the cabalist can remain as a living shadow for 1 minute per vigilante level instead, and can cast spells while he is a living shadow. A cabalist must be at least 12th level to select this talent.<br /><br />Necromantic Focus (Ex): The cabalist gains Spell Focus (necromancy) as a bonus feat. He also adds additional spells to his spellbook from the following list, provided he can cast spells of the appropriate level: 1st&mdash;cause fear, 2nd&mdash; blindness/deafness, 3rd&mdash;bestow curse, 4th&mdash;poison, 5th&mdash;feast on fearACG, 6th&mdash;slay living.<br /><br />Shadow Jump (Su): The cabalist gains the shadowdancer&rsquo;s shadow jump ability with an effective shadowdancer level equal to his vigilante level &ndash; 6. If he has levels in shadowdancer, those levels stack with his vigilante levels to determine the total distance per day he can shadow jump (to a maximum of 320 feet per day). A cabalist must be at least 10th level to select this talent.<br /><br />Tattoo Chamber (Su): The cabalist can magically absorb items through a tattoo on his hand or wrist and easily retrieve them or activate their magical abilities without making them manifest. The items seemingly disappear into the tattoo, but actually enter an extradimensional space that the cabalist can access via the tattoo. Stowing an item in this way requires a full-round action, and the space can store one item plus one additional item per 3 vigilante levels he has. These items must be items the cabalist can hold in one hand. Retrieving a stowed item requires mentally activating the tattoo as a swift action. The item appears in the cabalist&rsquo;s hand, so worn items must still be donned to gain their benefits. The cabalist can also activate any spell-trigger abilities of a stored item as though he were wielding the item, producing the magic effect from his tattoo rather than from the item. If the cabalist dies while items are within his tattoo chamber, those items fade into existence within 5 feet of the corpse.<br /><br />Bloodbound Spell (Ex): At 5th level, a cabalist gets an advantage when casting spells against bleeding foes. Whenever the cabalist casts a spell against a foe that is taking bleed damage, the foe takes a &ndash;1 penalty on its saving throw against the spell (or to its AC if the spell requires an attack roll). This penalty increases to &ndash;2 if the spell is from the necromancy school.<br /><br />This ability replaces startling appearance.<br /><br />Bloody Horror (Ex): At 11th level, when a cabalist casts a spell and one of the targets (or one creature in the area for an area spell) is taking bleed damage, the cabalist can, as a free action, make an Intimidate check to demoralize all targets of the spell (or all creatures in the area for an area spell). The cabalist rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets.<br /><br />Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that cabalist&rsquo;s bloody horror for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.<br /><br />This ability replaces frightening appearance.<br /><br />Shadowy Appearance (Sp): At 17th level, a cabalist becomes cloaked in shadow while in his vigilante identity. He gains a continuous 20% miss chance (as per blur). The cabalist can deactivate or reactivate this effect as a standard action. Once per day, he can spend an immediate action to gain the benefits of greater invisibility for 1d6 rounds.<br /><br />This ability replaces stunning appearance.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"Drj4nVxEAU8TuY8q"}

In sacrifice to him, they cut out their own tongues to gain magical protection from exposure and hunt down secrets to steal before they can be spread&mdash;which usually requires executing those who already knew them.<br /><br />Tongue Sacrifice (Su): An Anaphexia thought-killer&rsquo;s social identity is as a Pharasmin priest, one whom many people assume has taken a vow of silence since they speak so infrequently. In order to assume her vigilante identity, an Anaphexia thought-killer must cut out her own tongue as a standard action&mdash;an act that deals 1d4 points of damage plus 1 point of bleed damage and leaves her unable to speak (even to cast spells). The thought-killer gains the ability to cast regenerate as a spell-like ability once per day, and only to restore her own tongue.<br /><br />Monastic Communication (Ex): At 2nd level, an Anaphexia thought-killer is skilled at maintaining a disguise without speaking. She can communicate simple concepts through body language and pantomime as though passing a secret message using the Bluff skill, in half the time normally required to do so. The Anaphexia thought-killer gains a bonus on this check equal to 1/2 her vigilante level.<br /><br />This replaces the social talent gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Silent to Magic (Su): At 6th level, an Anaphexia thought-killer is protected by nondetection in her social identity but only against mind-reading effects. Her effective caster level is equal to her vigilante level. At 10th level, this protection also applies to the thought-killer&rsquo;s vigilante identity.<br /><br />This ability replaces the social talent gained at 6th level.<br /><br />Thought-Scent (Su): At 7th level, an Anaphexia thought-killer can smell a significant thought. As a standard action, she can choose one fact or idea she already knows, such as a secret she wishes to keep hidden, and can locate any creature within 30 feet who knows it as with the scent ability. The range increases to 60 feet if the creature is upwind and drops to 15 feet if the creature is downwind. She can discern the direction to the creature until she is adjacent, at which point she can pinpoint the creature&rsquo;s square. This is a mind-affecting divination effect. The Anaphexia thought-killer can use this ability for up to 1 minute per level. These minutes need not be consecutive but must be used in 1-minute intervals.<br /><br />This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 7th level.<br /><br />False Reading (Su): At 15th level, an Anaphexia thought-killer is immune to all effects attempting to read her mind in both her social and vigilante identities. The Anaphexia thought-killer can attempt a Bluff check to provide false results to the creature attempting to read her thoughts, which the target can see through with a successful opposed Sense Motive check.<br /><br />This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 15th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"Gt14jfNJoiuLgDfC"}
{"name":"Vigilante (Masked Maiden)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adventurer's Guide pg. 82</a><br />In the wake of Ileosa&rsquo;s death, some of the surviving Gray Maidens attempted to return to their former lives&mdash;a task made difficult by the physical and emotional scars of their indoctrination. For a few, suppressing the indoctrination&rsquo;s effects seemed to work. In time, though, the repressed aspects returned, pushing these former conscripts to don their armor and seek out conflict. These so-called masked maidens find themselves leading a double life: ordinary (albeit troubled) citizen by day, faceless warrior by night. In the most tragic cases, the identities entirely disassociate, with the maiden experiencing unexplained exhaustion and injuries upon awakening.<br /><br />While their social identities cover a wide range of personality types, in their vigilante identities, masked maidens are usually icy and dispassionate. These identities are rarely good-aligned, and are more often merciless bringers of justice than gentle redeemers. Some masked maidens continue enforcing the queen&rsquo;s cruel agenda, while others fight crime or pursue personal vendettas. A masked maiden always uses the iconic Gray Maiden helm when in her vigilante identity, as these helms serve excellently at both hiding the vigilante&rsquo;s identity while simultaneously evoking the significant social gravitas associated with the Gray Maidens. Often, the masked maiden wears signature garb, such as a helm with a distinctively colored plume or a scarlike etching on the helm&rsquo;s face, or perhaps a unique cloak. Although the masked maiden hides behind the armor and is pursuing her goals, she wants to be able to be identified as a specific individual.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: All masked maiden vigilantes are proficient with Gray Maiden plate armor (see page 84), but not with any other forms of heavy armor.<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Imperfect Control (Ex): A masked maiden compulsively resists entering her indoctrinated state, but certain triggers (such as violence) can cause her to lapse. The masked maiden always starts the day in her social identity. To begin willingly changing to her vigilante identity, the masked maiden must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half her vigilante level); if she fails, she becomes shaken for 1 minute and cannot try again during that time. While in her social identity, when the masked maiden is exposed to mortal peril (such as when combat starts), she must succeed at a Will save at the same DC or be compelled to enter her vigilante identity as soon as she can get out of sight to do so. The masked maiden cannot choose to fail this Will save. In addition, if the masked maiden hasn&rsquo;t entered her vigilante identity for a week or longer, she must attempt this Will save at the start of each day; on a failure, she is compelled to change into her vigilante identity immediately (or as soon as she can slip out of sight to do so).<br /><br />A masked maiden can don Gray Maiden plate in 1 minute without aid, and can do so as part of switching to her vigilante identity. If the maiden reduces the time it takes to change identities (such as with the quick change social talent), she can still don her armor as part of changing to her vigilante identity. A masked maiden who changes to her vigilante identity unwillingly can&rsquo;t choose to switch from her vigilante identity back to her social identity that day. While in her vigilante identity, the masked maiden takes a &ndash;2 penalty on all Charisma-based ability and skill checks (except for Intimidate) and can&rsquo;t benefit from morale bonuses or bardic performances.<br /><br />This ability alters dual identity.<br /><br />Scars of the Past (Ex): A masked maiden must choose avenger as her vigilante specialization. A 1st-level masked maiden gains a set of Gray Maiden plate at no cost. This armor is battered, and other creatures are never considered proficient with it. This armor can be sold only as scrap for 4d6 gp, but for the masked maiden the armor functions normally. The masked maiden can spend 150 gp and 1 day of work to improve her battered armor to masterwork quality (although it is still considered battered).<br /><br />This ability replaces seamless guise.<br /><br />Armor Training (Ex): All Gray Maidens were drilled in the use of their armor, and as a masked maiden continues to lapse in and out of indoctrination, that training emerges slowly from her subconscious. At 3rd level, a masked maiden gains the fighter&rsquo;s armor training class feature, and at 19th level she gains armor mastery. She treats her vigilante level as her fighter level for the purposes of both.<br /><br />This replaces the vigilante&rsquo;s social talents gained at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"HW0LhVeBOefvYFMj"}

While Bellflower tillers (see page 40) wander the countryside, escorting the crop of escapees to freedom, Bellflower harvesters remain in seeming bondage to direct others to the road to freedom, undermine efforts to recapture slaves, and end the threat of especially vile masters. Bellflower harvesters consist almost exclusively of halflings, though the role could be taken by anyone with the patience or humility to withstand months or years of cruel abuse without risking being caught raising a hand in his own defense.<br /><br />Rebellious Identity (Ex): A Bellflower harvester&rsquo;s vigilante identity must be within one step of chaotic good, and his social identity must appear to be a servant, slave, or other menial laborer.<br /><br />This alters dual identity.<br /><br />Bellflower Crop (Ex): As a standard action, a Bellflower harvester can designate a number of allies equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier as part of his Bellflower crop. Members of a Bellflower crop must remain within 30 feet of the vigilante to gain any benefits from abilities that affect a Bellflower crop, regardless of the ability&rsquo;s source (whether it&rsquo;s a Bellflower harvester, irrigator, or tiller). If the allies leave this range, the Bellflower harvester must designate them again to include them in his crop.<br /><br />Crop Vigilance (Ex): When the Bellflower harvester uses the aid another action to grant a member of his Bellflower crop a bonus on an attack roll against an opponent, on a skill check, or to AC against an opponent&rsquo;s next attack, the bonus increases to +3. This doesn&rsquo;t stack with the benefits of other feats or class features that improve the bonus he grants to an ally with aid another. At 5th level and every 6 vigilante levels thereafter, the bonus that the Bellflower harvester provides when using aid another to assist a member of his Bellflower crop increases by 1, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level.<br /><br />This ability replaces vigilante specialization, but the Bellflower harvester is still treated as if he had the stalker specialization for the purpose of selecting other vigilante talents.<br /><br />Obsequious (Ex): A Bellflower harvester works hard to cultivate a social identity that plays off others&rsquo; racist assumptions to deflect blame and excuse suspicious behavior, making him seem harmless or even a model servant. He can use the Bluff skill to deflect suspicion about his vigilante identity and activities (including use of vigilante talents when in his social identity) rather than Disguise, and gains a +2 bonus on Bluff checks to do so. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 vigilante levels he has beyond 1st, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level.<br /><br />This ability replaces the social talent gained at 1st level.<br /><br />Tend the Garden (Ex): At 2nd level, a Bellflower harvester gains the ability to coordinate the members of his Bellflower crop to improve their performance in battle. He gains Stealth SynergyUC as a bonus feat. As a standard action, a Bellflower harvester can grant any one teamwork feat he has to all members of his Bellflower crop who can see and hear him. Members of his Bellflower crop retain this feat for 1 round, plus 1 round for every 5 vigilante levels the Bellflower harvester has beyond 2nd, to a maximum of 4 rounds at 17th level. A Bellflower harvester can share only one teamwork feat at a time in this manner.<br /><br />This ability replaces the vigilante talent gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Social Talents: The following social talents complement the Bellflower harvester: case the jointUI, feign innocenceUI, gossip collectorUI, loyal aidUI, and subjective truthUI.

Unlike other mutants, who are usually shunned in Alkenstar and other settlements, mutated defenders can appear in public without revealing their mutations&mdash;though they can still use them to their full potential in secret.<br /><br />Mutant Specialization: A mutated defender gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed in the vigilante&rsquo;s class table. He adds this value as normal to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice. He also selects one mutant deformity (Bestiary 5 180) other than mindless or vulnerability. This deformity magically reverts when the vigilante is in his social identity, as do all mutations from his mutant talents, allowing him to hide his mutation entirely. Unlike with other vigilante talents, the vigilante is entirely unable to use the benefits of his mutant talents while in his social identity.<br /><br />This replaces vigilante specialization.<br /><br />Mutant Talents: At 2nd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter, a mutated defender can select from the following mutant talents, in addition to the vigilante talents normally available to him.<br /><br />This alters vigilante talent. <br /><br />Mutant Blast (Su): One of the mutated defender&rsquo;s extremities becomes elementally warped, and he can discharge a blast of energy from this limb. This functions as the elemental ray bloodline power (from the elemental sorcerer bloodline) and uses his vigilante level as his sorcerer level. The mutated defender chooses the damage type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) of his mutant blast when selecting this talent. The mutated defender must be at least 9th level to select this talent.<br /><br />Mutant Evolution: The mutated defender gains a 1-point evolution from the eidolon list other than climb, improved natural armor, mount, skilled, or swim. He must meet any prerequisites as normal, using his vigilante level for prerequisites that require a summoner level. He can select an evolution granting a natural attack without fulfilling the subtype requirement, though he must replace one of his hands with the natural weapon.

The rule of King-Regent Noleski Surtova grows increasingly tenuous; to hold his position, he sends handpicked agents into the kingdom&rsquo;s courts to flush out traitors to the Dragonscale Throne. When not acting as courtiers, these agents don fearsome draconic masks, becoming anonymous protectors of the kingregent&rsquo;s rule.<br /><br />Ruby Courtier (Ex): Surtova&rsquo;s minions pose as minor nobles studying the Aldori swordlord traditions common throughout Brevoy. At 1st level, a Dragonscale loyalist gains Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling swordISWG) as a bonus feat. His social identity must appear to be that of a noble, and he can&rsquo;t select double time, many guises, or any social talent inappropriate for a noble social identity.<br /><br />This ability alters social talents and replaces the 1st-level social talent.<br /><br />Reflexive Reaction (Ex): A Dragonscale loyalist lacks the conviction of other vigilantes, but his reactions are keenly honed. At 3rd level, if a Dragonscale loyalist acts during a surprise round, he can take a full round&rsquo;s worth of actions. If he does, he is staggered during the first full round of combat.<br /><br />This ability replaces unshakable.<br /><br />False Allegiance (Ex): Eventually, a loyalist begins training to infiltrate one of Brevoy&rsquo;s great houses. At 5th level, a Dragonscale loyalist chooses one of the seven houses of Brevoy, gaining a bonus feat and a special ability appropriate to the chosen house. He need not meet the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites.<br /><br />House Garess: The Dragonscale loyalist gains Sure GraspUC and dwarves&rsquo; stonecunning racial trait.<br /><br />House Lebeda: The Dragonscale loyalist gains Skill Focus (Appraise). He can also resell items for 60% of their listed value, rather than 50%. The purchase limit of the settlement must be high enough to accommodate the increased value.<br /><br />House Lodovka: The Dragonscale loyalist gains Sea LegsUC. When attempting Swim checks, he ignores the armor check penalty of light or medium armor. If the loyalist has the heavy training vigilante talent, this applies to heavy armor as well.<br /><br />House Medvyed: The Dragonscale loyalist gains Endurance and the druid&rsquo;s resist nature&rsquo;s lure class feature.<br /><br />House Orlovsky: The Dragonscale loyalist gains Call TruceUI and a +3 bonus to his CMD.<br /><br />House Rogarvia: The Dragonscale loyalist gains Skill Focus (Knowledge [history]) and a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information.

At 11th level, while in his vigilante identity, a Dragonscale loyalist is treated as constantly being under the effects of perceive betrayal . This effect&rsquo;s caster level is equal to the Dragonscale loyalist&rsquo;s vigilante level, and he doesn&rsquo;t require material components or a focus.<br /><br />This ability replaces the vigilante&rsquo;s frightening appearance.<br /><br />Conqueror&rsquo;s Wrath (Ex): Inspired by the deeds of Chora the Conqueror, a loyalist can rampage through enemy ranks.

But deception takes a toll, and some half-elves form alternate identities to let the suppressed side of their heritage be known. This other identity can be either a force for good, enabling the half-elf to express a part of himself that has been denied to him, or for evil, with the half-elf hurting others to make up for his own pain.<br /><br />Dual Heritage: A half-elf double scion appears to be an elf in one identity and a human in the other identity. He takes no penalties to Disguise checks to appear as the race that matches his current identity. The selection of which race is the social identity and which is the vigilante identity is made at 1st level and cannot be changed. Additionally, when a half-elf double scion switches from one identity to another, he is representing different aspects of his heritage rather than personality. As a result, a half-elf double scion has the same alignment in both of his identities.<br /><br />This alters dual identity.<br /><br />Half-Elf Double Scion Talents: A half-elf double scion can select from the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents. Elven Weapon Command (Ex): A half-elf double scion can wield traditional elven weapons as well as elves can. The half-elf double scion treats any weapon with the word &ldquo;elven&rdquo; in its name as a martial weapon, and gains <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus\">Weapon Focus</a> as a bonus feat for one such weapon.<br /><br />Arrogant Strike (Ex): A half-elf double scion has a highly confident style in battle, characteristic of both humans and elves. A half-elf double scion can declare that he is using this ability at the beginning of his turn as a free action. He automatically confirms any critical hits until the beginning of his next turn. He can use this ability once per day plus one additional time at 14th level and 18th level. A half-elf double scion must be at least 10th level to select this talent.<br /><br />Slick Step (Ex): A half-elf double scion can, as a move action, move 10 feet without provoking an attack of opportunity. This movement cannot pass through an opponent&rsquo;s square and must otherwise be a legal movement. He cannot draw a weapon during this movement.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"Pt8akfPmK1a9f29S"}

Her study of these arts allows her to hide her dual nature and enchant her enemies&mdash;or simply blast them with furious magical attacks.<br /><br />Class Skills: The warlock adds Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft to her list of class skills, instead of Disable Device, Knowledge (engineering), Perception, and Survival.<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Skill Ranks per Level: The warlock gains a number of skill ranks equal to 4 + her Intelligence modifier at each level, instead of 6 + her Intelligence modifier skill ranks.<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s skill ranks per level.<br /><br />Armor Proficiencies: A warlock is not proficient with medium armor. Like a magus, she can cast her spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance.<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Spellcasting: A warlock casts arcane spells and cantrips as a magus. She prepares spells using a spellbook, choosing them from the 6th-level and lower spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list; higher-level sorcerer/wizard spells are not on the warlock&rsquo;s spell list.<br /><br />This replaces the 4th-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 16th-level vigilante talents.<br /><br />Spellbook: A warlock has a spellbook that functions in the same way as a magus&rsquo;s spellbook but uses the 6th-level and lower spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list.<br /><br />Mystic Bolts (Su): A warlock can sling projectiles of magical energy at will by shooting a bolt or touching her foe. A melee mystic bolt requires the target to be within reach, and a ranged mystic bolt is a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet. A mystic bolt deals 1d6 points of damage plus 1 for every 4 vigilante levels the warlock has. The warlock must choose one type of damage for her mystic bolt: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Attacking with a mystic bolt takes the place of one of the warlock&rsquo;s normal attacks, and she can make a full attack using mystic bolts. The warlock vigilante attacks with mystic bolts as though they were light one-handed weapons, and the bolts can be used for two-weapon fighting (with each hand creating one mystic bolt) and feats and abilities that apply to weapon attacks (unless they&rsquo;re excluded from that feat, such as with Power Attack). Weapon Focus (ray) doesn&rsquo;t apply to mystic bolts, but a warlock can take Weapon Focus (mystic bolt) and apply it to both melee and ranged mystic bolts.<br /><br />Creating a mystic bolt requires the hand to be free, but the bolt appears only briefly, so a warlock using mystic bolts has a free hand any time she isn&rsquo;t attacking with a mystic bolt. The warlock threatens with a mystic bolt, but only if she has a hand free. Because mystic bolts are impermanent, a spell that targets a single weapon (like magic weapon) can&rsquo;t affect it, nor can a mystic bolt be made with magic weapon special abilities. Abilities that affect all weapon attacks the warlock makes, such as the arcane striker warlock talent, function with mystic bolts.<br /><br />At 7th level and every 6 vigilante levels thereafter, the warlock chooses another damage type from the list above. Each time she creates a mystic bolt, she can have it use any one of the damage types she has selected.<br /><br />This ability replaces vigilante specialization.<br /><br />Piercing Bolts (Ex): At 3rd level, the warlock can choose one mystic bolt per round to be a touch attack. This turns a melee mystic bolt into a melee touch attack or a ranged mystic bolt into a ranged touch attack. At 5th level, the warlock can treat all of her mystic bolts as touch attacks.<br /><br />This ability replaces unshakable. <br /><br />Warlock Talents: A warlock can select from any of the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents.<br /><br />This alters vigilante talents.<br /><br />Arcane Striker (Su): The warlock gains Arcane Strike as a bonus feat. At 12th level, when she activates Arcane Strike, she can choose to also give her weapons the flaming, frost, shock, or thundering weapon special ability. She makes this choice each time she activates Arcane Strike, and it lasts for the same duration. At 16th level, she adds anarchic, axiomatic, flaming burst, holy, icy burst, shocking burst, and unholy to the list of special abilities she can select. She can choose to apply an alignment-based weapon special ability only while in her vigilante identity, and only if it matches the alignment of her vigilante identity.<br /><br />Elemental Armor (Su): When in her vigilante identity, the warlock gains armor made of elemental energy. She is surrounded by a nimbus of ice, lightning, or flames, granting her resistance 5 to cold, electricity, or fire, respectively. The damage type must be chosen when she selects this talent, and it can&rsquo;t be changed. At 4th level, the warlock&rsquo;s armor deals 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type to any creature striking the warlock with a natural weapon or a non-reach melee weapon. A creature that attempts a grapple combat maneuver check against the warlock also takes this damage. A creature can take damage in this way no more than once per round. At 8th level, the energy resistance increases to 10. At 12th level, the damage increases to 2d6 points. At 16th level, the warlock becomes immune to the chosen damage type while in her vigilante identity.<br /><br />Familiar (Ex): The warlock gains a familiar, using her vigilante level as her effective wizard level. The familiar also has a social identity as a seemingly normal animal, though warlocks with outlandish familiars might still need to hide them.<br /><br />Social Simulacrum (Sp): The warlock can create a shortlived simulacrum (as lesser simulacrum on page 238 of Ultimate Magic) that duplicates her social identity, allowing her to appear to be in two places at once. Creating the duplicate takes 1 hour and requires no material component cost. It lasts for 4 hours before turning back into an inert pile of snow. The duplicate replicates only the warlock&rsquo;s social identity, with the same alignment and social talents. It has no magical abilities, and can&rsquo;t assume a vigilante identity. As with the spell, the simulacrum isn&rsquo;t under the warlock&rsquo;s control. The warlock can create a social simulacrum no more than once per day and can have only one in existence at a time. A warlock must be at least 8th level to select this talent.<br /><br />Tattoo Chamber (Su): This talent functions as the cabalist ability of the same name.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"SfERm5Narm8bcALv"}

In order to accomplish this task, select members of the Lantern Bearers undergo a horrific ritual allowing them to temporarily experience the dark transformation into a drow, but at the cost of their sanity.<br /><br />Elven Ancestry: A darklantern must be a creature with the elf subtype.<br /><br />Dark Identity (Su): At 1st level, a darklantern can transform into her vigilante identity as a full-round action. When a darklantern switches to her vigilante identity, she undergoes a horrifying transformation from an elf into a drow. After the transformation is complete, the darklantern takes on the appearance of a drow (but otherwise retains her normal facial features and voice) and gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, darkvision with a range of up to 60 feet, and the light blindness universal monster ability. While in her vigilante identity, the darklantern counts as a drow for the purpose of any ability, spell, or magic item targeting drow. A darklantern&rsquo;s vigilante identity must be chaotic evil, but her social identity can be more than one step removed from this alignment.<br /><br />Transforming back into the darklantern&rsquo;s social identity requires a move action. However, a darklantern must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + the number of hours she has been in her vigilante identity) in order to successfully transform back into her social identity; otherwise, the move action is wasted and the action cannot be attempted for 1 minute.

Donning terrifying masks, these vigilantes forsake their humanity to become more like the evil beings they mimic.<br /><br />Yokai Heart (Su): A Chu Ye enforcer seeks to transmute himself into a destructive spirit and terrorize his enemies. His vigilante identity alignment must be non-good.

The mask has 10 hit points per vigilante level he has and hardness 5. While wearing the mask, the Chu Ye enforcer gains a bonus to Intimidate equal to 1/2 his level (minimum +1).

He takes no penalty on combat maneuver checks with the noose for having the noose in his hand, but he still doesn&rsquo;t add any bonuses he might have with a net or whip (such as weapon enhancement bonuses or benefits from Weapon Focus) on the check. He can spend 1 minute to weave a magical or masterwork net or whip into a noose, thereafter gaining these benefits with it.<br /><br />This ability replaces the 2nd-level vigilante talent.<br /><br />Bound to Truth (Ex, Sp): At 3rd level, a hangman adds half his vigilante level to his Sense Motive checks to notice lies told by a creature entangled or grappled by his noose, by feeling the creature&rsquo;s throat clench or changes in its breathing. In addition, he can prevent a creature entangled or grappled in his noose from lying by tightening the noose, as per a single-target zone of truth (the caster level equals his vigilante level; the save DC is Charisma-based). He can use the latter ability a number of rounds per day equal to half his vigilante level. These rounds don&rsquo;t need to be consecutive.<br /><br />This ability replaces unshakable.<br /><br />Twisted Rope (Su): At 4th level, a hangman can spend 1 hour preparing his noose, granting it temporary hit points equal to his vigilante level, giving it a hardness equal to 1/2 his vigilante level plus double the weapon&rsquo;s enhancement bonus (or its current hardness, whichever is better), and changing its break DC to 23 + 1/2 his vigilante level (or its current break DC, whichever is better).

A successful Fortitude save (DC = 15 + the hangman&rsquo;s Strength bonus) negates the suffocation. On subsequent rounds, the hangman can maintain the grapple to suffocate the target again. On the next failed save, the target drops to &ndash;1 hit points and starts dying. On the third failed save, she dies.

While their infamous reputations spread far, striking fear in their foes, the individual behind the mask remains a complete mystery.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: A faceless enforcer is proficient with heavy armor, but not with shields.<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Dual Identity (Ex): A faceless enforcer&rsquo;s vigilante identity is tied to a particular helmet or face covering and suit of armor. Switching between identities means donning or removing this armored outfit. Switching identities means entirely donning or removing armor (even if it is donned hastily) and never takes less than the minimum amount of time to do so. How long this takes depends on the type of armor, as detailed on page 153 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Once per month, the vigilante can replace the helmet or face covering and armor associated with his vigilante identity and buy or make a new outfit that becomes tied to that identity. A faceless enforcer cannot select the immediate changeUI or quick changeUI social talents.<br /><br />This ability alters dual identity.<br /><br />Armored Juggernaut (Ex): At 2nd level, a faceless enforcer does not need help donning half-plate or full-plate armor, but donning it alone takes him 8 minutes. At 4th level, he can don his half-plate or full-plate alone in 4 minutes, and can don it hastily in 2 minutes. At 6th level, he doesn&rsquo;t apply the armor check penalty for any armor on Acrobatics, Escape Artist, or Stealth checks, but the penalty applies on other skill checks as normal. At 8th level, a faceless enforcer can move 5 feet faster than normal in heavy armor, to a maximum of his base speed. At 10th level, it takes him 2 minutes to don heavy armor, 1 minute to don it hastily, and 1 minute to remove it. At 16th level, he can move at full speed in heavy armor. At 18th level, it never takes the vigilante more than 1 minute to don his armor.<br /><br />This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Faceless Infiltrator (Ex): At 5th level, when he changes his identity, a faceless enforcer has a third option (instead of social or vigilante) he can assume a fictional identity with no known ties to his Hellknight affiliation, his social identity, or his vigilante identity. When he gains this ability, the faceless enforcer must choose a group, organization, or social structure he wishes to infiltrate (such as the beggars in Egorian&rsquo;s Cheapside or the city&rsquo;s congregation of the Midnight Temple to Asmodeus), and the fictional identity he creates must be a recruit, ally, or prospective employee of that group. This fictional identity&rsquo;s alignment must be within one step from either his vigilante or his social identity. A faceless enforcer can use social and vigilante talents when in his fictional identity, but he risks exposing his secret when he does so.<br /><br />When he gains this ability, the faceless enforcer creates mundane records that can verify his fictional identity. While he is in his fictional identity, a faceless enforcer appears to be an otherwise ordinary member of his race, and he receives a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear to be the fictional person he says he is. He must create the appearance for this fictional identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. If the faceless enforcer changes from his vigilante identity to his fictional identity and vice versa, changing identities takes him the normal amount of time to don or remove his armor (see the armored juggernaut ability). If he changes from his fictional identity to his social identity and vice versa, it takes him 1 minute. Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the fictional identity work as normal if the faceless enforcer is in his fictional identity. Otherwise, it reveals a random member of the group he is attempting to infiltrate.<br /><br />At 11th level, the faceless enforcer&rsquo;s bonus on Disguise checks to appear to be his fictional identity increases to +20. Any spell or ability designed to locate the fictional individual while the faceless enforcer is in that identity has a 50% chance of instead finding a random member of the group. Although this ability does not give the faceless enforcer any special knowledge of the group outside what he gleans himself, the faceless enforcer&rsquo;s training grants him a +10 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks to maintain his fictional guise.<br /><br />At 17th level, attempts to scry or otherwise locate the faceless enforcer&rsquo;s fictional identity always reveal a random member of the group he has infiltrated. Furthermore, his bonus on Bluff checks to maintain his fictional identity increases to +15.<br /><br />Every month, a faceless enforcer can create a new fictional identity, if he wishes, but not another fictional identity that is attempting to infiltrate the same group. A faceless enforcer cannot select the any guiseUI, everymanUI, or many guisesUI social talents.<br /><br />This ability replaces the social talents gained at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.<br /><br />Enforcer&rsquo;s Wrath (Ex): At 6th level, a faceless enforcer has become adept at using his vigilante identity to terrify and coerce lone enemies, particularly among the group he is currently infiltrating. He gains a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks against enemies when no other opponents are within 30 feet of him (or the creature he is intimidating). This bonus stacks with any bonuses the vigilante receives from renown or similar abilities. Additionally, if the vigilante successfully demoralizes a lone opponent with Intimidate, the opponent is shaken for 1 additional round.<br /><br />This ability replaces the vigilante talent gained at 6th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"dEvQ1gHUoh97EugQ"}

A serial killer whose vigilante identity becomes nonevil cannot gain new levels as a vigilante but retains all of her class abilities.<br /><br />Vigilante Specialization: A serial killer must choose the stalker specialization. Her hidden strike is considered equivalent to a sneak attack with the same number of dice for the purpose of meeting prerequisites or using abilities that depend on sneak attack.<br /><br />This alters vigilante specialization.<br /><br />Thwart Pursuit (Ex): At 3rd level, a serial killer adds 1/2 her vigilante level as a bonus on all checks in a chase (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 232) and to the DCs of Diplomacy checks to gather information about her and checks to track her or notice her tracks (though not to the DC of the profiler&rsquo;s expert profiler ability; see page 55).<br /><br />This ability replaces unshakable.<br /><br />Studied Target (Ex): At 4th level, a serial killer gains the studied targetACG ability of a slayer 3 levels lower, including the ability to study multiple targets simultaneously at the appropriate levels. The serial killer does not provoke attacks of opportunity when attempting a coup de grace against a studied target.<br /><br />This ability replaces the 4th- and 14th-level vigilante talents and the 9th- and 19th-level social talents.<br /><br />Charming (Ex): At 5th level, a serial killer gains the charmAPG hex as if she were a witch of her vigilante level, but she can&rsquo;t affect animals.

The serial killer chooses her calling card when she gains this ability, and the first time she uses it in an area where she has renown (as per the renown social talent), it becomes associated with her killings. After that, once citizens of a new settlement find this calling card, the serial killer immediately establishes the settlement as an area of renown for her vigilante identity without spending additional time to spread tales, and the Intimidate bonus from renown increases by 2. She still must spend time to establish her social identity&rsquo;s renown.<br /><br />This replaces the 7th-level social talent.<br /><br />Grisily Murder (Ex): At 11th level, a serial killer gains Dreadful CarnageAPG as a bonus feat, and if she leaves a calling card, the murder is so horrifying that creatures examining the corpse are affected as per nightmare that night (DC = 10 + 1/2 the serial killer&rsquo;s vigilante level + her Charisma modifier). The nightmare affects a number of creatures equal to the serial killer&rsquo;s Charisma modifier, starting with the first creature to examine the corpse.<br /><br />This replaces frightening appearance.<br /><br />Quiet Death (Ex): At 12th level, a serial killer gains the quiet death class feature as if she were an assassin.<br /><br />This ability replaces the 12thlevel vigilante talent.<br /><br />Swift Death (Ex): At 17th level, a serial killer gains the swift death class feature as an assassin.<br /><br />This ability replaces the vigilante&rsquo;s stunning appearance.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"eEGo1dZrBZtjZBeG"}

One may be kind and calm while the other is angry and heartless, and the change from one identity to another is sudden and frightening. The splintersoul is torn by conflicting emotions and thoughts, but because of his dual mind, he can master a uniquely disparate set of skills and abilities no normal person should be able to manage.<br /><br />Splintered Identity (Ex): A splintersoul&rsquo;s two identities are even more distant from one another than those of a normal vigilante. He cannot use any of his vigilante talents while in his social identity.<br /><br />However, for the purpose of qualifying for classes, feats, and other abilities, he is eligible if one of his alignments meets the requirements. While in an identity whose alignment is incompatible with an ability, class, or feat, he temporarily loses access to the feat or ability or is treated as an ex-member of the class, as appropriate.<br /><br />For example, a splintersoul with barbarian levels, a lawful-good social identity, and a neutral vigilante identity can&rsquo;t use his vigilante talents or his rage class feature while in his social identity, but he regains these abilities and can use them as normal as soon as he changes to his vigilante identity.<br /><br />A splintersoul with paladin levels must follow the paladin&rsquo;s normal code of conduct while in a lawful-good identity, but while in an identity with a different alignment, the following changes apply to his code: Willingly committing an evil act (for example, casting a spell with the evil descriptor) still causes the vigilante to become an ex-paladin, but otherwise, he can do whatever else he feels is necessary to uphold the causes of law and good. He should strive to act with honor and uphold the tenets of his faith, but failing to do so is not a violation of his code. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, other classes or archetypes with similarly strict codes of conduct can also follow a less strict version of a code of conduct while in an identity with an incompatible alignment.<br /><br />This alters dual identity.<br /><br />Sudden Change (Ex): More adaptive than other vigilantes, a splintersoul must select the quick change social talent at 3rd level and the immediate change social talent at 7th level, ignoring the minimum levels for those talents.<br /><br />This replaces unshakable and alters the social talents gained at 3rd and 7th levels.<br /><br />Surprising Change (Ex): At 7th level, when a splintersoul uses the immediate change talent to reveal his vigilante identity and then attacks a foe in the same round, he can use the startling appearance ability against that foe as though the foe were unaware of his presence. At 11th and 17th levels, he can use frightening appearance and stunning appearance, respectively, while using this ability. A splintersoul can use frightening appearance and stunning appearance only against foes who are unaware of his presence, and he can do so a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier. This ability doesn&rsquo;t function against foes who already know the splintersoul&rsquo;s identity.<br /><br />This alters startling appearance, frightening appearance, and stunning appearance.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"glVXO5n95nwmS6vL"}

He can take alchemical discoveries in place of vigilante talents, but only discoveries that affect his mutagen (including cognatogenUM discoveries).

If he fails, he transforms as if he had consumed his mutagen (determine which ability score gets the bonus randomly). This doesn&rsquo;t consume his mutagen, and lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + his vigilante level, after which the transformation ends and he becomes fatigued. While transformed in this way, he is confused, and he rerolls any result of &ldquo;act normally.&rdquo; Since the confusion is part of the mutagenic transformation, abilities that prevent or remove confusion don&rsquo;t apply to this effect, though abilities that end the effect of a mutagen work normally.

Many of these trace back to the agathiel tradition, first stolen from agathion celestials by the elves of Kyonin and again later by Old-Mage Jatembe. Agathiels surrender a portion of their immortal souls to Nirvana in exchange for a measure of animalistic might to aid them in their righteous crusades. This exchange is permanent, and each agathiel commits the rest of his mortal life to service of others and the constant thrum of wild instincts. Though agathiels can be found in small numbers all over Golarion, the rituals to transform a mortal into an agathiel are common only in Kyonin and the Mwangi city-states, and among the wandering scholars of the Mwangi Expanse. The elves in particular relied upon these abilities to scout Golarion before reclaiming their abandoned territories after the Age of Darkness, leading to reports of extraordinary fey animals stalking elven ruins in the century before their return.<br /><br />Immortal Commitment (Su): Becoming an agathiel commits a portion of the vigilante&rsquo;s soul to Nirvana, and in turn invests him with a portion of the plane&rsquo;s power. An agathiel&rsquo;s social and vigilante identity alignments must both be within one step of neutral good. If either of the agathiel&rsquo;s alignments moves outside this range (because of his own actions or magical manipulation), he gains 1 permanent negative level and loses the ability to assume his vigilante identity until both of his alignments are within one step of neutral good. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) until the agathiel&rsquo;s alignment reverts. <br /><br />Bestial Identity (Su): At 1st level, an agathiel&rsquo;s vigilante identity must invoke the appearance and behavior of a single Small or Medium creature of the animal type. The vigilante can attempt to appear to be a normal member of this animal type, but doing so imposes a &ndash;10 penalty on his Disguise check. The bonus provided by seamless guise still applies to the vigilante&rsquo;s attempts to appear to be an ordinary animal. Once the vigilante&rsquo;s animal form is selected, it cannot be changed. <br /><br />Beginning at 4th level, when an agathiel assumes his vigilante identity, he physically transforms into an animal, though he always retains unusual traits that set him apart from ordinary animals, as if using beast shape I, except the vigilante gains no ability adjustments and can select only a single animal ability from those listed in the spell&rsquo;s description. His social identity remains his true form, and unlike with beast shape I, an agathiel can remain in his animal form indefinitely. The agathiel&rsquo;s vigilante identity is considered a polymorph effect, and while in his vigilante identity, the agathiel is immune to other polymorph effects. Unlike with normal polymorph effects, the agathiel&rsquo;s equipment does not meld into his form, and instead changes shape to fit his animal form and provides the same function, though any equipment requiring hands cannot be used until he returns to his social identity. <br /><br />At 8th level, when assuming his vigilante identity, the vigilante can select two abilities provided by beast shape I, or select a single ability provided by beast shape II. At 12th level, he can instead select two abilities provided by beast shape II, or a single ability provided by beast shape III. At 16th level, he can instead select three abilities provided by beast shape III, or a single ability provided by beast shape IV. <br /><br />This ability alters dual identity and replaces the vigilante talents gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th levels. <br /><br />Agathion Blessing (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, an agathiel gains Aspect of the BeastAPG as a bonus feat while in his vigilante identity. If he selects the claws of the beast option, he can select a bite attack (1d8), a gore attack (1d8), or 2 slam attacks (1d4 each), as appropriate to his animal identity. <br /><br />This ability replaces the vigilante talent gained at 2nd level.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"kIEUEZZHdLUwIi1R"}

This mask symbolizes one specific animal, and the animal cannot be changed once chosen. Without this mask, an avenging beast cannot assume his vigilante identity.

The avenging beast treats his vigilante level as his druid level for the purposes of this ability.

{"name":"Vigilante (Wildsoul)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6p?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Intrigue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Intrigue pg. 61</a><br />Within some vigilantes are incredible innate abilities that, although normally the domain of natural beasts, inexplicably aid them in fighting their enemies. These vigilantes have ties to the creature whose abilities they emulate, whether from a distant lycanthrope ancestor, a divine touch, unnatural experimentation, or something else altogether.<br /><br />Natural Course (Ex): At first level, when a wildsoul chooses a vigilante specialization, he must also choose a natural course: arachnid, falconine, or ursine. This represents the type of creature that influences his body, granting him his remarkable abilities. Once this choice is made, it can&rsquo;t be changed.<br /><br />At 2nd, 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, a wildsoul gains a specific ability tied to his natural course. These abilities count as vigilante talents, as onlookers who see the wildsoul in his social identity use them overtly might suspect him of being something more than he appears; the more obvious animalistic abilities (like bear form and shoot webs) impart a &ndash;10 penalty on the wildsoul&rsquo;s Disguise check to appear as his social identity.<br /><br />This alters vigilante specialization and replaces the vigilante talents gained at 2nd, 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.<br /><br />Arachnid: These wildsouls have the blood of spiders running through their veins. Heightened Senses (Ex): At 2nd level, an arachnid wildsoul can anticipate physical danger and react astonishingly quickly. He gains the stalker sense vigilante talent, even if he is not a stalker.<br /><br />Shoot Webs (Ex): At 6th level, an arachnid wildsoul&rsquo;s wrists can produce thick, sticky webbing that he can shoot at his enemies. Shooting webbing is a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. The webbing acts as a tanglefoot bag when it hits a creature, except the DC of the Reflex save to avoid being glued to the floor or unable to fly is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arachnid wildsoul&rsquo;s vigilante level + his Constitution modifier. Like a tanglefoot bag, the webbing does not work underwater. The arachnid wildsoul can shoot webs a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Constitution modifier.<br /><br />Web Specialist (Ex): At 12th level, an arachnid wildsoul can coat his hands and feet in super-sticky webbing, even over equipment such as gloves and boots. This gives him a climb speed of 30 feet. Additionally, as a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity, an arachnid wildsoul can use his webbing to create the equivalent of a 50-foot length of silk rope (hp 4, break DC 24) and can shoot it at any flat, unoccupied surface that is at least one 5-foot square in size. If the arachnid wildsoul succeeds at a ranged attack against AC 10, the rope sticks fast to the surface, can only be removed if it is destroyed, and can support the weight of the arachnid wildsoul plus one additional Medium or smaller creature. If more creatures attempt to use the webbing rope, it is destroyed. This costs a daily use of shoot webs.<br /><br />Web Master (Ex) At 18th level, an arachnid wildsoul can use web specialist without spending a daily use of shoot webs. Additionally, he can create numerous web-ropes as he is moving and swing from rope to rope, essentially allowing him to move at his base speed through the air as long as he always uses at least one hand to hold the webbing and continues to have tether points within 50 feet and above him. The web ropes he creates in this way dissolve as soon as he is done using them to swing.<br /><br />Falconine: These wildsouls have the blood of falcons or other large birds of prey running through their veins.<br /><br />Soft Landing (Ex): At 2nd level, a falconine wildsoul can grow feathery wing-flaps under his arms that allow him to fall slowly. He gains the perfect fall vigilante talent.<br /><br />Eagle Eye (Ex) At 6th level, a falconine wildsoul hones his visual senses. He gains a competence bonus equal to half his vigilante level on visual Perception checks.<br /><br />Take to the Air (Ex) At 12th level, a falconine wildsoul can harness the flight inherent in his blood. While in his vigilante identity, he has feathery wings that grant him a fly speed of 40 feet (with good maneuverability).<br /><br />Deadly Dive (Ex): At 18th level, a falconine wildsoul has learned how to mimic the swooping and diving of birds of prey. As a full-round action while he is flying at least 30 feet above the ground, a falconine wildsoul can dive onto a creature by moving up to twice his fly speed and make a single melee attack. The movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, and the attack provokes an attack of opportunity from the attack&rsquo;s target. If the attack is successful, the falconine wildsoul deals the attack&rsquo;s damage plus 2d6 points of damage for every 10 feet he dove (to a maximum of 20d6 damage if he dove 100 feet or more). Even if the attack misses, the target still takes the extra damage for the distance of the dive, but it receives a Reflex save to halve the damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the falconine wildsoul&rsquo;s vigilante level + his Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher). A falconine vigilante can dive in this way a number of times per day equal to his Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher.<br /><br />Ursine: These wildsouls have the blood of bears running through their veins.<br /><br />Deadly Claws (Ex): At 2nd level, an ursine wildsoul&rsquo;s hands become claws in his vigilante identity, granting him two claw attacks. These are primary natural attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage if he is Medium or 1d3 if he is Small.<br /><br />Bear Jaws (Ex): At 6th level, an ursine wildsoul gains a bite attack while in his vigilante identity. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of damage if he is Medium or 1d3 if he is Small.<br /><br />Thick Hide (Ex): At 12th level, an ursine wildsoul in his vigilante identity has skin that bristles with thick hair like that of a bear&rsquo;s. He gains a natural armor bonus of +1. This natural armor bonus increases by 1 at 16th and 20th levels.<br /><br />Bear Form (Su): At 18th level, an ursine wildsoul has learned how to take a bear&rsquo;s form. He can change into bear form as a standard action, at will, and the transformation lasts until he changes back. While transformed, he becomes a grizzly bear (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 31) as beast shape II. An ursine wildsoul loses his ability to speak while in bear form and is limited to the sounds that a normal bear can make, though he can communicate normally with other bears, as speak with animal.<br /><br />Feline: <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of the Beast pg. 7)</a> Feline wildsouls have the blood of great cats running through their veins.<br /><br />Feline Attributes (Ex): At 2nd level, a feline wildsoul gains the low-light vision and scent special abilities and reduces any penalty he takes on Perception checks due to distance by an amount equal to 1/2 his vigilante level (minimum 0). If he also gains low-light vision or scent from a feat or racial trait, he instead gains a +2 bonus on Perception checks for each ability he already has. In addition, he can take Aspect of the BeastAPG, ignoring the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites.<br /><br />Feline Grace (Ex): At 6th level, a feline wildsoul gains uncanny dodge, using his vigilante level as his effective rogue level. At 12th level, he also gains improved uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Feline Pounce (Ex): At 12th level, a feline wildsoul can strike quickly and lethally at a moment&rsquo;s notice. He gains the mad rush avenger vigilante talent, even if he is not an avenger.<br /><br />Nine Lives (Su): At 18th level, a feline wildsoul can survive attacks that would kill lesser vigilantes. He gains the defensive roll advanced rogue talent and can use this ability eight times per day.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"rRaeNXmOg3tVr1CL"}

Gunmasters brandish firearms like extensions of their will, taking down their foes with deadly accuracy and skill.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: A gunmaster is proficient with all firearms but not with martial weapons or medium armor.<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Gunmaster: At 1st level, a gunmaster gains the gunslinger&rsquo;s gunsmith ability (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 9). Additionally, the Gunsmithing bonus feat allows the gunmaster to repair and restore his initial battered firearm as if he were a gunslinger. At 5th level, and every 4 vigilante levels thereafter, the gunmaster gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with all firearms.<br /><br />This ability replaces vigilante specialization.<br /><br />Gunmaster Talents: A gunmaster can select from any of the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents.<br /><br />This alters vigilante talents.<br /><br />Deadeye (Ex): Once per day, the gunmaster can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing one increment beyond his firearm&rsquo;s first range increment. The gunmaster still takes the &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls for shooting a target outside the firearm&rsquo;s first range increment. At 6th level and every 4 vigilante levels thereafter, he can use this ability one additional time per day. A gunmaster can spend multiple daily uses to resolve an attack at a further range increment (for instance, he can spend three uses to resolve an attack three increments beyond his first range increment).<br /><br />Death&rsquo;s Shot (Ex): Three times per day, as an immediate action when the gunmaster scores a critical hit, he can attempt to kill his enemy instantly. When the gunmaster uses this talent, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunmaster&rsquo;s vigilante level + his Dexterity modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target dies instantly. A gunmaster must be 20th level to select this talent.<br /><br />Gunmaster Initiative (Ex): The gunmaster gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if he has the Quick Draw feat, his hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, he can draw a single firearm as part of the initiative check. A gunmaster must be at least 4th level to select this talent.<br /><br />Lightning Reload (Ex): A number of times per day equal to half his vigilante level, a gunmaster can reload a single barrel of a one-handed or two-handed firearm as a swift action once per round. If he has the Rapid Reload feat or is using an alchemical cartridge (or both), he can reload a single barrel of the weapon as a free action each round instead. Using this talent does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A gunmaster must be at least 12th level to select this talent.<br /><br />Quick Clear (Ex): Once per day as a standard action, the gunmaster can remove the broken condition from a single firearm he is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. Starting at 12th level, once per day, when the gunmaster rolls a misfire with a gun that has the broken condition, she can prevent the gun from exploding, though it retains the broken condition.<br /><br />Nimble (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a gunmaster gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunmaster to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunmaster to lose this dodge bonus.

Mounted furies often masquerade as anonymous stable hands or humble quartermasters to mask their vigilante activities.<br /><br />Class Skills: A mounted fury adds Handle Animal to his list of class skills, instead of Swim and Use Magic Device.<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Thorough Change: A mounted fury must take care when changing from one identity to another, including making any changes necessary to ensure that his mount is not associated with his social identity and vice versa (although if anyone suspects him of being anything other than what he appears to be while in his social identity, he need not make a separate Disguise check for his mount). The mounted fury always requires 1 minute to change identities, regardless of other effects that reduce the time required, and he cannot choose the immediate change or quick change social talents.<br /><br />This alters dual identity.<br /><br />Mount (Ex): A mounted fury gains the service of a loyal and trusty steed to carry him into battle. This mount functions as a druid&rsquo;s animal companion, using the mounted fury&rsquo;s vigilante level as his effective druid level. The creature must be one that he is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium mounted fury can select a camel or a horse. A Small mounted fury can select a pony or a wolf, but can also select a boar or a riding dog if he is at least 4th level. The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts. A mounted fury can exchange or replace his mount the same way that a druid exchanges or replaces her animal companion.<br /><br />A mounted fury does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained and begins play with Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. A mounted fury&rsquo;s mount does not gain the share spells ability.<br /><br />A mounted fury&rsquo;s bond with his mount is strong, with the pair learning to anticipate each other&rsquo;s moods and moves. At 3rd level, the mounted fury&rsquo;s mount shares all his teamwork feats, without needing to meet the prerequisites (although while mounted, the mounted fury and his mount do not count as separate creatures for the purpose of these feats). At 5th level, the mounted fury&rsquo;s mount benefits from the vigilante&rsquo;s startling appearance as if it were the vigilante. Should a mounted fury&rsquo;s mount die, the mounted fury may find another mount to serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link or devotion special abilities until the next time the mounted fury gains a level.<br /><br />A mounted fury can select avenger vigilante talents, despite not being an avenger. He can also select a teamwork feat for which he qualifies in place of a vigilante talent; at 10th level, he gains an additional teamwork feat each time he does so (if he selected any teamwork feats in place of vigilante talents before 10th level, he gains an additional teamwork feat at 10th level for each time he did so).<br /><br />This ability replaces vigilante specialization.<br /><br />Furious Charge (Ex): At 6th level, a mounted fury learns to make more accurate charge attacks while mounted. The mounted fury and his mount receive a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2). In addition, the mounted fury and his mount don&rsquo;t take any penalty to AC after making a charge attack while mounted.<br /><br />This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 6th level.<br /><br />Mighty Charge (Ex): At 12th level, a mounted fury learns to make devastating charge attacks while mounted. He doubles the critical threat range of any weapons he wields during a charge while mounted, as well as the critical threat range of the mount&rsquo;s attacks. This increase does not stack with other effects that increase the threat range of weapons. In addition, the mounted fury can make a free bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his charge attack is successful. This free combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.<br /><br />This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 12th level.<br /><br />Vengeance Strike (Ex): At 20th level, a mounted fury need not be mounted while he studies a target against whom he plans a vengeance strike, but he must be mounted when he makes the strike&rsquo;s attack.<br /><br />This ability alters vengeance strike.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"rlKL30e1SCjOmEgD"}

However, he gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.<br /><br />This alters the vigilante&rsquo;s armor and weapon proficiencies.<br /><br />Brute Form (Ex): Though it is sometimes difficult to maintain, a brute has a measure of control over his abilities.<br /><br />While in his vigilante identity, a brute becomes one size category larger, gaining no ability score adjustments but otherwise gaining all adjustments for his new size, including additional reach, if appropriate. A brute&rsquo;s vigilante identity is savage and dangerous. While in his vigilante identity, the brute takes a &ndash;2 penalty to AC, as well as to all ability checks and skill checks that rely on Charisma, Dexterity, or Intelligence. Furthermore, the brute cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting). When a brute is in mortal peril, such as when combat starts, if he is in his social identity, he must succeed at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 his vigilante level) or enter his vigilante identity. Entering his vigilante identity in this way is a horrifying and painful process that takes 1 full round, during which he is flat-footed, and it typically allows his enemies to see his transformation and learn his identity. The brute&rsquo;s vigilante identity can&rsquo;t always tell friend from foe. While he still attacks enemies preferentially during a battle, when there are no more enemies around, each round he must succeed at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 his vigilante level) or continue fighting against his allies or bystanders. Allies can use the aid another action to assist this saving throw with skills like Diplomacy, as they attempt to calm him down. On a successful save, he slowly turns back to his social identity over the course of 1 minute (or shorter if he has a social talent that reduces that time).<br /><br />A brute uses his vigilante level as his base attack bonus, but only while he is in his vigilante identity. At 5th level, while in his vigilante identity, the brute gains a +1 bonus on melee attack and damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 13th level and to +3 at 19th level. He uses his normal base attack bonus to qualify for feats and other abilities, although when in his vigilante identity, he uses his increased base attack bonus to determine the effects of feats (such as Power Attack) and other abilities.<br /><br />A brute&rsquo;s mundane clothes and armor do not increase in size with him, and any such items he wears while changing into his vigilante identity lose one-quarter of their hit points. Magical clothes and accessories increase in size with the vigilante, however (though his magical armor and weapons initially do not, as normal).<br /><br />A brute can stay in his vigilante identity for up to 2 hours at a time, for a total of up to 6 hours in a 24-hour period. When threatened in his vigilante identity, he has the potential to damage bystanders or allies. After switching from his vigilante identity to his social identity, he is fatigued for the same amount of time (rounds, minutes, or hours) that he spent in his vigilante identity and cannot remove or ignore this fatigue by any means except by waiting the appropriate amount of time. If he enters his vigilante identity while fatigued, once he switches back to his social identity, he becomes exhausted for the amount of time he just spent in his vigilante identity, and he also can&rsquo;t remove or ignore the exhaustion by any means other than waiting the appropriate length of time. A character with immunity to fatigue or exhaustion cannot adopt a brute form at all; that immunity prevents the transformation as an effect that would cause fatigue or exhaustion.<br /><br />An exhausted brute can only enter his vigilante identity for a number of rounds equal to half his vigilante level (minimum 1); following these rounds, the brute immediately falls unconscious, or into a stupor if he is somehow prevented from falling unconscious. In this state, a brute can be healed as normal (and, if he has 0 hit points or more, he returns to consciousness after receiving any amount of magical healing or a DC 15 Heal check), but he cannot enter his vigilante identity for 1 hour.<br /><br />This ability replaces vigilante specialization.<br /><br />Brute Talents: A brute can select from any of the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents.<br /><br />This alters vigilante talents.<br /><br />Awesome Blow (Ex): The brute has learned that his body is his most formidable weapon. He gains the Awesome Blow monster feat as a bonus feat, but only while in his vigilante identity. He can ignore the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites. His awesome blow combat maneuver deals an amount of damage equal to 1d6 plus his Strength modifier, or his unarmed strike damage, whichever is better. At 16th level, the brute can use Awesome Blow against a creature of any size, and he can bull rush, dragAPG, repositionAPG, and trip creatures of any size. A brute must be at least 8th level to select this talent.<br /><br />Heavy Punches (Ex): The brute eschews civilized combat and prefers to wade into a fight with his fists swinging. While in his vigilante identity, the brute&rsquo;s unarmed strikes deal damage as if he were a monk of his size and vigilante level. If he has levels in other classes that provide monk advancement for unarmed strike damage, his vigilante level stacks with those levels whenever he is in his vigilante identity.<br /><br />Scale Surroundings (Ex): Instead of letting physical barriers stop him, the brute can simply climb over them. He gains a climb speed of 30 feet when he is in his vigilante identity. A brute must be at least 4th level to select this talent. Sizing Equipment (Ex): The brute has learned how to adjust his magic armor so that it provides him some protection while in his vigilante identity. Magic armor the brute wears that is sized for his social identity provides an armor bonus equal to its normal armor bonus &ndash; 1 while he is in his vigilante identity. In addition, wielding a magic weapon properly sized for his social identity deals damage as if it were a magic weapon properly sized for his vigilante identity, but it imposes a &ndash;1 penalty on attack rolls. At 6th level, he takes no penalties when using such weapons and armor, and his weapons and armor work in all ways (including damage dice) as if they were of the vigilante&rsquo;s new size. This talent only applies to magic arms and armor; inappropriately sized mundane arms and armor are not affected.<br /><br />Total Destruction (Ex): The brute is adept at rampaging through an area, throwing whatever is available at his opponents. The brute gains Throw Anything as a bonus feat. As a standard action, while in his vigilante identity, he can throw any unattended object up to two size categories smaller than he is up to 60 feet if he is Medium and 80 feet if he is Large. This deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage if he is Medium or 1d8 if he is Large, and the brute adds 1-1/2 times his Strength modifier to this damage. At 8th level, he can also throw a creature up to two size categories smaller than himself, but he must succeed at a combat maneuver check against that creature&rsquo;s CMD to do so. The thrown creature lands prone and takes an amount of damage equal to the damage dealt to the target of the throw (as noted above), whether the brute hits or misses. At 16th level, he can instead throw an object one size category larger than himself at creatures within a 10-foot radius from the object&rsquo;s point of impact. These creatures must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brute&rsquo;s vigilante level + his Strength modifier) or take 1d6 points of damage per vigilante level.<br /><br />Tear Them Apart (Ex): At 20th level, a brute has learned how to tear at his enemies&rsquo; bodies when he hits with multiple attacks. When he takes a full attack action while in his vigilante identity, if a brute hits an opponent with at least two attacks, he deals an additional 1d10 points of damage plus 1-1/2 times his Strength modifier. If he hits an opponent with four attacks during a full attack action while in his vigilante identity, he instead deals an additional 3d10 points of damage plus 1-1/2 times his Strength modifier. The damage occurs after he has taken his last attack with the full attack action. This counts as a rend and does not stack with other abilities that grant rend.<br /><br />This ability replaces vengeance strike.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Vigilante","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","_id":"rxv0VXkClNHgPs1o"}
