The vampire hunter believes that the worst of the undead are the ones with unnatural appetites for flesh and blood&mdash;things that should persist without feeding, but consume anyway. Vampires and ghouls are especially dangerous because they turn their victims into more of their kind, and just one reckless night-feeder can turn an entire city into a den of undead.<br /><br />Vampire hunters use their skills and magic to track and slay the hungry dead, walking a fine line between the purity of good magic and the tempting evil of turning dark necromancy against the unliving. Rare even in grim Ustalav, and slain on sight in Nidal and Geb, vampire hunters lead lonely existences under the constant threat of becoming that which they live to destroy. A vampire hunter has the following class features.<br /><br />Judgment: The following vampire hunter judgments work differently than those of a standard inquisitor.<br /><br />Purity: At 10th level, the judgment bonus is doubled against diseases and energy drain saving throws, but not curses or poisons.<br />Smiting: At 6th level, the vampire hunter&rsquo;s weapons count as silver instead of an alignment type.<br /><br />Silversmith: At 2nd level, a vampire hunter learns the secrets of crafting silver into dangerous weapons. She adds a bonus equal to her class level on any Craft or Spellcraft check made to create a silver item that bypasses DR/silver, such as alchemical silver, silversheen, or silver weapon blanch (see the Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide). This ability replaces detect alignment.<br /><br />Bane (Su): A vampire hunter can only imbue her weapons with the undead-bane ability, but it persists even when she isn&rsquo;t holding the weapon.<br /><br />Sun Strike (Su): At 5th level, a vampire hunter can infuse a single weapon she wields with the purifying light of the sun as a swift action for a number of rounds per day equal to her inquisitor level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. While a weapon is infused with the sun, it deals +1d6 points of damage to any creature that is susceptible or vulnerable to sunlight, including many types of undead (particularly spectres, vampires, and wraiths). This additional damage also applies to oozes and fungus-based monsters.

This ability replaces monster lore.<br /><br />Detect Magic (Sp): At 2nd level, an iconoclast gains the ability to detect magic at will. This ability replaces detect alignment.<br /><br />Dispelling Attack (Sp): At 5th level, once per day as a standard action, an iconoclast can make a melee or ranged attack against an opponent, and if she hits, she can affect that opponent as if she had cast dispel magic, using the targeted dispel option. If she misses, this ability is wasted. Use her inquisitor level as the caster level of the dispel magic effect. This ability replaces discern lies. <br /><br />Negating Critical (Sp): At 14th level, when an iconoclast confirms a critical hit, the creature she hit must succeed at a Fortitude save at DC 10 + 1/2 the iconoclast&rsquo;s caster level + the iconoclast&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier for each non-artifact magic item the target is wearing or carrying.

An umbral stalker gains access to the following judgment.<br /><br />Stalking: The umbral stalker gains a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls against creatures that are unaware of her presence (typically because she is invisible or using Stealth).

Whenever she confirms a critical hit against a foe that is unaware of her presence, she ignores any damage reduction the target might have and adds her Wisdom bonus to her damage roll (this multiplies on the critical hit as normal); in addition, if the target has regeneration, the creature loses regeneration on the round following the critical hit and can die normally during that round.

When they work together as one, there are few that dare to stand in their way.<br /><br />Animal Companion (Ex): At 1st level, a sacred huntsmaster forms a bond with an animal companion. This ability works as the hunter class feature of the same name, using her inquisitor level as her hunter level. This ability replaces judgment 1/day.<br /><br />Hunter Tactics (Ex): At 3rd level, a sacred huntsmaster automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&rsquo;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats. This ability replaces solo tactics.<br /><br />Animal Focus (Su): At 4th level, a sacred huntsmaster can take on the aspects of an animal as a swift action. This ability works as the hunter&rsquo;s animal focus class feature, with her inquisitor level serving as her hunter level. This ability replaces later iterations of the judgment ability.<br /><br />Improved Empathic Link (Su): At 8th level, the sacred huntsmaster gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the sacred huntsmaster can also see through a companion&rsquo;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The sacred huntsmaster is blinded while maintaining this connection. This ability replaces second judgment.<br /><br />Raise Animal Companion (Sp): At 16th level, a sacred huntsmaster gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability (not restricted to her own animal companion). Using this ability gives the sacred huntsmaster a negative level that cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal. This ability replaces third judgment.<br /><br />Second Animal Focus (Ex): At 17th level, whenever a sacred huntsmaster uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&rsquo;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a sacred huntsmaster can take on an aspect. If her animal companion is dead and the sacred huntsmaster has applied that aspect to herself, that aspect counts toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The sacred huntsmaster can still only apply one of her dead companion&rsquo;s to herself, not both. This ability replaces slayer.<br /><br />Greater Empathic Link (Su): At 20th level, the range of a sacred huntsmaster&rsquo;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, it and the sacred huntsmaster can communicate telepathically.

The spellbreaker, by contrast, learns to recognize and resist certain types of magic, wading through waves of magic to reach her foes.<br /><br />Strong-Willed (Ex): At 1st level, a spellbreaker is able to stand strong against magical effects that seek to control, compel, or persuade her. The spellbreaker rolls twice and takes the best result when making a Will saving throw against a mind-affecting effect. This ability replaces monster lore.<br /><br />Defense against Magic (Ex): At 3rd level, a spellbreaker picks a single wizard school. She gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against arcane spells of that school. Every four levels beyond 3rd, the spellbreaker picks a new school and gains this bonus against arcane spells of that school (to a maximum of five schools of magic at 19th level). Furthermore, each time the spellbreaker picks a new school, the bonuses for the schools she has already chosen increase by 1. This ability replaces all bonus teamwork feats.<br /><br />Foil Casting (Su): At 3rd level, when an opponent tries to cast an arcane spell within a spellbreaker&rsquo;s threatened area, the DC for that caster to cast defensively increases by 2. This increase stacks with the effects of the Disruptive feat. Furthermore, the spellbreaker knows where to hit foes to foil casting from a distance. Each time she hits an arcane spellcaster or a creature that uses spell-like abilities with a ranged weapon attack, the DC of any Concentration checks the caster makes increases by 2 for 1 round. This ability replaces solo tactics. <br /><br />Impervious (Ex): At 20th level, a spellbreaker becomes immune to the effects of a single school of arcane magic. That school of magic must be the first one she picked for defense against magic (see above). Neither harmful nor helpful arcane spells of that school have an effect on the spellbreaker. If a spell of that school is an area of effect spell, the spell goes off as normal, but the spellbreaker is untouched by its effects. Once per day, as a swift action, the spellbreaker can grant this imperviousness to all allies in a 60-foot burst for 1 minute.

Creatures of this alignment are her sworn enemies. She can detect creatures of that specific alignment at will, functioning as detect evil, except this ability works only on creatures and detects the specific alignment.<br /><br />At 6th level, once per day as a swift action, a faith hunter can smite one foe she can see. If the foe is of the faith hunter&rsquo;s sworn enemy alignment, the faith hunter gains a +4 sacred bonus on attack rolls against that foe and a sacred bonus equal to half her inquisitor level on damage rolls made against the foe. Smites against targets of the faith hunter&rsquo;s sworn enemy alignment automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess. If the faith hunter targets a creature that is not of her sworn enemy alignment, the smite is wasted with no effect.<br /><br />The smite effect remains until the foe is dead or the next time the faith hunter rests and regains her uses of this ability. At 10th level and every 4 inquisitor levels thereafter, a faith hunter can smite her enemies one additional time per day, to a maximum of four times per day at 18th level. A faith hunter does not gain the justice or destruction judgments.<br /><br />This ability replaces domain and alters judgment.<br /><br />Enemy Revealed (Su): At 2nd level, when a faith hunter uses her sworn enemy ability to identify a creature&rsquo;s alignment (typically on the third round of concentrating on an area including the creature), she can reveal that creature&rsquo;s alignment aura, causing it to glow for 1 round per inquisitor level so that even creatures with regular vision can see the aura.

Often they come into conflict with those hostile to their teachings or to the preacher&rsquo;s need to help those who cannot help themselves. The leaders of evil or aggressive religions send these preachers into new territories to win converts and hopefully allies. Often, they start uprisings against powers hostile to their religion, or defend a group of honest believers from the depredations of the unfaithful.<br /><br />Determination (Ex): At 3rd level, the preacher is a person of few words on the battlefield, but those words hold great power and authority. Once per day, the inquisitor can use this ability to create one of the following effects. Each is a free action to use.<br /><br />Aggression: The preacher may reroll an attack roll that she just made before the results of the roll are revealed. She must take the result of the reroll, even if it&rsquo;s worse than the original roll.<br /><br />Defense: When the inquisitor would be hit by a melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action she may add a +4 insight bonus to her Armor Class against that attack, and if this makes the inquisitor&rsquo;s AC higher than the opponent&rsquo;s attack roll, the attack misses.<br /><br />Warning: When a preacher&rsquo;s ally within line of sight would be hit by a melee or ranged attack, she may call out a warning to that ally, and the attacker must reroll the attack and use the results of the second roll. The ally must be able to hear the preacher and must not be helpless for this ability to have any effect.<br /><br />Whenever the preacher could select a bonus teamwork feat (at 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level), she can instead choose to increase her number of uses per day of this ability by one.

Sometimes these sanctified slayers are given special dispensation to commit ruthless murders for the faith&rsquo;s greater good. Other times, they&rsquo;re simply willing to take the initiative to revel in the zeal of such grisly work.<br /><br />Studied Target (Ex): At 1st level, a sanctified slayer gains the slayer&rsquo;s studied target class feature. She uses her inquisitor level as her effective slayer level to determine the effects of studied target. This ability replaces judgment 1/day.<br /><br />Sneak Attack (Ex): At 4th level, if a sanctified slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot to deal extra damage. The sanctified slayer&rsquo;s attack deals additional damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether or not the target actually has a Dexterity bonus), or when the sanctified slayer flanks her target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should a sanctified slayer score a critical hit with the sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.

Unlike most inquisitors, a living grimoire focuses on careful study of divine scripture, valuing knowledge over intuition.<br /><br />Holy Book (Su): At 1st level, a living grimoire forms a supernatural bond with a large ironbound tome containing the holy text of his deity and learns to use it as a weapon. When wielding the holy book as a weapon, he deals base damage as if it were a cold iron light mace (but see Sacred Word below), is considered proficient with the book, takes no improvised weapon penalty, and gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with the book. The tome serves as his holy symbol and divine focus, and can be enchanted as a magic weapon. He can replace his bonded tome with another book at any time, though he must perform a 24-hour binding ritual to attune himself to the new book.<br /><br />This ability replaces monster lore.<br /><br />Spells: A living grimoire must prepare his spells ahead of time, and can know any number of inquisitor spells. He uses Intelligence instead of Wisdom as his key spellcasting ability score (to determine his spell DCs, bonus spells per day, modifier on concentration checks, and so on), and to determine the effects and number of uses of his domain powers.<br /><br />The living grimoire receives the same number of spell slots per day as a warpriest of his inquisitor level, and receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score. He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by choosing a time each day for 1 hour of quiet contemplation while he studies his holy book.<br /><br />At 1st level, the living grimoire&rsquo;s holy book contains all 0-level inquisitor spells plus three 1st-level inquisitor spells of his choice. He also selects a number of additional 1st-level inquisitor spells equal to his Intelligence modifier to add to his holy book. At each new inquisitor level, he gains two new inquisitor spells of any spell levels he can cast (based on his new inquisitor level) for his holy book. At any time, he can learn inquisitor spells from scrolls or other written sources and add inquisitor spells he finds to his holy book.<br /><br />This ability alters orisons and spellcasting and replaces cunning initiative.<br /><br />Sacred Word (Su): At 1st level, a living grimoire learns to charge his holy book with the power of his faith. The inquisitor gains the benefits of the warpriest&rsquo;s sacred weaponACG class ability, but the benefits apply only to his bonded holy book. Like a warpriest&rsquo;s sacred weapon, the living grimoire&rsquo;s book deals damage based on the inquisitor&rsquo;s level, not the book&rsquo;s base damage (unless the inquisitor chooses to use the book&rsquo;s base damage).<br /><br />At 4th level, the living grimoire gains the ability to enhance his holy book with divine power as a swift action. This ability grants the holy book a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 4 inquisitor levels the living grimoire has beyond 4th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the holy book might have, to a maximum of +5. The living grimoire can enhance his holy book to have any of the special abilities listed in the warpriest&rsquo;s sacred weapon ability, subject to the same alignment restrictions, but adds bane to the general special ability list. Adding any of these special abilities to the holy book consumes an amount of enhancement bonus equal to the special ability&rsquo;s base price modifier. The holy book must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before the living grimoire can add any special abilities to it. The living grimoire can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his inquisitor level, but these rounds don&rsquo;t need to be consecutive. As with the warpriest sacred weapon ability, he determines the enhancement bonus and special abilities the first time he uses the ability each day, and they cannot be changed until the next day.<br /><br />This ability replaces judgment.<br /><br />Blessed Script (Su): At 5th level, a living grimoire can permanently tattoo one spell of 2nd level or lower from his holy book onto his body. The tattooed spell cannot have an expensive material component or focus. The living grimoire can prepare any tattooed spell without needing his holy book, and can cast his tattooed spells as a spell-like ability once per day.<br /><br />At 8th level, the living grimoire can tattoo one additional spell of 3rd level or lower upon himself. At 12th level, he can tattoo one additional spell of 4th level or lower upon himself, and at 16th level he can tattoo a final additional spell of any level upon himself.<br /><br />When the living grimoire uses these spell-like abilities, the tattooed holy script associated with the spell-like ability glows as per light for a number of rounds equal to the spell&rsquo;s level.<br /><br />This ability replaces bane, greater bane, second judgment, and third judgment.<br /><br />Word of God (Su): At 20th level, a living grimoire can smite his foes with the holy word of his deity. Up to seven times per day, the inquisitor can make a single melee attack with his holy book against a target. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or die (DC = 10 + 1/2 the living grimoire&rsquo;s inquisitor level + his Intelligence modifier). Regardless of whether the save is successful, the target creature is immune to the living grimoire&rsquo;s word of god ability for 24 hours. Once the living grimoire uses this ability, he can&rsquo;t use it again for 1d4 rounds.<br /><br />This ability replaces true judgment.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Inquisitor","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-red.jpg","_id":"ITrHJhebFoQUPjHE"}

Any spell or orison gained by the relic hunter has a relic component (see Relics below), and is not considered to be on the relic hunter&rsquo;s spell list until she selects its school though the relics alternate class feature. Once she chooses a school, all spells and orisons of that school are considered to be on the relic hunter&rsquo;s class spell list, allowing her to use spell trigger and spell completion magic items of those spells. A relic hunter&rsquo;s spells per day, daily spell allotment, Difficulty Class, and minimum Wisdom score requirements remain unchanged from the inquisitor&rsquo;s normal spellcasting class feature. This ability alters the inquisitor&rsquo;s spellcasting.<br /><br />Relics (Su): At 1st level, a relic hunter gains the occultist&rsquo;s implements class feature (see page 47) and learns to use two occultist implement schools as relic schools. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the relic hunter learns to use one additional relic school drawn from the same source, gaining access to that school&rsquo;s resonant power and base focus power and opening up that school&rsquo;s focus powers for her to select. Like an occultist, a relic hunter can select the same school twice, but it is far less useful for her to do so.<br /><br />Relics do not need to be magic items, and nonmagical relics do not take up a magic item slot. Relics that are not magic items are often of some religious significance to the relic hunter or her church, such as the battered shield of a saint, a bishop&rsquo;s robe, or the finger bone of a church martyr.<br /><br />This ability replaces judgment.<br /><br />Deific Focus (Su): At 1st level, a relic hunter learns to invest divine power into her chosen relics. This acts like the occultist&rsquo;s focus powers and mental focus class features (see pages 47 and 48, respectively), with the following adjustments.<br /><br />Each day, a relic hunter has a number of points of deific focus equal to her inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier, and she must spend 1 hour in prayer with her relics to invest them with divine power. These points refresh at the start of each day.<br /><br />At 1st level, the relic hunter learns the two base focus powers from her chosen relic schools and can select one more focus power from the list of those made available by her chosen schools. Whenever she gains a new relic school, she gains the base focus power of that school. In addition, at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, she learns a new focus power selected from all of the powers granted by all of the relic schools she knows. She can use these focus powers only by expending points of deific focus. Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throws against a focus power is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor&rsquo;s class level + the inquisitor&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier. She cannot select a focus power more than once. She uses her inquisitor level in place of an occultist level to qualify for focus powers.<br /><br />This ability replaces domain, bane, greater bane, second judgment, and third judgment.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Inquisitor","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-red.jpg","_id":"Kw6X0CNRoa3gWxGo"}

These inquisitors learn to use the hexes and some spells of witches, but must pay the price for dealing with supernatural powers, as they slip ever closer to the evil they seek to destroy.<br /><br />Withering Gaze (Su): Hexenhammers study the effects of a witch&rsquo;s evil eye, and can use this dark magic to steel their gaze in a similar manner. Beginning at 1st level, whenever a hexenhammer successfully demoralizes a creature as a standard action, instead of applying the shaken condition, she can apply the effects of the witch evil eyeAPG hex as if she were a 1stlevel witch (save DC = 10 + 1/2 the hexenhammer&rsquo;s inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier).<br /><br />This ability replaces monster lore and stern gaze.<br /><br />Pride and Penance (Ex): Hexenhammers are deeply conflicted about their dealings with dark powers. If a hexenhammer uses a hex or casts a spell gained from the witch class spell list, she temporarily loses access to her domain abilities and her cunning mind bonus until she undergoes a brief period of penance and atonement that takes 1 minute of quiet prayer and contemplation; this atonement doesn&rsquo;t require any additional cost, and it automatically restores the lost abilities, regardless of how many times the hexenhammer uses her dark powers. If the hexenhammer uses her dark trade ability (see below) to trade uses of judgment for hexes, she loses access to her domain abilities and cunning mind bonus until the next time she regains her spell slots for the day.<br /><br />This ability alters domain.<br /><br />Cunning Mind (Ex): At 2nd level, a hexenhammer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against hexes, curses, spells of the necromancy school, and spells with the evil descriptor.<br /><br />This ability replaces cunning initiative.<br /><br />Hexcrafter (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a hexenhammer learns to turn some powers of witches to her own advantage. She learns either the blightAPG, the misfortuneAPG, or the slumberAPG hex from the witch&rsquo;s hex list, and can use that hex once per day as a standard action, using her inquisitor level in place of a witch level. If the hex allows a saving throw, the save DC to resist the hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor&rsquo;s level + the inquisitor&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier.<br /><br />At 6th level, 12th, and 15th levels, the hexenhammer learns an additional hex from her available hexes. At 9th level and 18th level, the hexenhammer can use any one of her hexes one additional time per day. At 12th level, the hexenhammer adds the agonyAPG, nightmaresAPG, and retributionAPG major hexes to her list of learnable hexes.<br /><br />This ability replaces teamwork feats.<br /><br />Dark Trade (Su): At 3rd level, a hexenhammer can forgo the power of her judgments and succumb to the temptation of darker powers. She can trade a daily use of judgment to instead gain an additional use of one of her hexes.<br /><br />This ability replaces solo tactics.<br /><br />Witchcraft (Ex): At 5th level and at every 3 inquisitor levels thereafter, a hexenhammer can learn a witch spell in place of a spell she already knows. In effect, she loses an old spell in exchange for a new one selected from the witch class spell list.

More benign versions of the practice believe that sin, or evil, is taken out of the world when a sin is devoured, denying the enemy&rsquo;s soul to the enemy&rsquo;s god and purifying the world of its taint. Followers of malevolent churches believe that consuming the sins of good folk not only corrupts the enemy soul to keep it from the celestial planes, but also taints the souls of those who witness the sin-eating or the corpse of its victim. Consuming sins empowers the sin eater, at least for a time.<br /><br />Eat Sin (Sp): At 1st level, as a free action, when the sin eater inquisitor kills an enemy, she may eat the sins of that enemy by spending 1 minute adjacent to its corpse. This provokes attacks of opportunity. The inquisitor can rush this ritual, performing it as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, but she only gains half the normal benefit (see below).<br /><br />Eating the enemy&rsquo;s sins heals the inquisitor of a number of hit points of damage equal to 1d8 + her inquisitor level (maximum +5). The enemy must have been killed by the sin eater within the last hour, and it must have had at least as many Hit Dice as half the inquisitor&rsquo;s level. The inquisitor can use this ability once for each enemy she kills. This ability has no effect on mindless creatures or those with Intelligence 2 or less.<br /><br />At 5th level, the healing increases to 2d8 plus her inquisitor level (maximum +10); it increases to 3d8 + her inquisitor level (maximum +15) at 9th level and to 4d8 + her inquisitor level (maximum +20) at 13th level.<br /><br />In some faiths, this &ldquo;eating&rdquo; is a purely symbolic act, while in others, the inquisitor must eat a small amount of food and water as part of the ritual. A few extreme faiths actually require the inquisitor to eat some of the body of the slain enemy.<br /><br />At 8th level, when a sin eater eats the sins of a creature that would rise as an undead (such as someone slain by a shadow, spectre, or vampire), the sin eater may choose to accept 1 temporary negative level to absorb the taint in the corpse, preventing it from rising as an undead. This negative level can be removed with the appropriate magic, though it automatically expires after 24 hours, and never becomes a permanent negative level. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, this ability may prevent a ghost from using its rejuvenation ability.<br /><br />This ability replaces an inquisitor&rsquo;s domain.<br /><br />Speak with Dead (Sp): At 6th level, when the inquisitor eats an enemy&rsquo;s sins, within 10 minutes of doing so, she can ask the remnants of the enemy&rsquo;s soul questions as if using speak with dead, with a caster level equal to her inquisitor level. She does not need the enemy&rsquo;s corpse to use this ability (she can eat sin, move away from the corpse, then use speak with dead), though the soul gets a saving throw just as a corpse would. This ability replaces the bonus teamwork feat gained at 6th level.<br /><br />Burden of Sin (Sp): At 14th level, a sin eater may spend a full-round action to transfer one harmful affliction, condition, or spell effect from another creature to herself (this includes curses, possessions, and permanent effects such as petrification, or any condition that break enchantment can end or reverse). The effect to be transferred is chosen by the sin eater and affects her as if she were the original target, continuing its duration (if any) and preventing any further effect on the original bearer. For example, the inquisitor could transfer a lethal disease to herself, or petrify herself to restore a petrified comrade. The sin eater can use this ability as often as desired, even using it multiple times on the same creature.

She brings burning retribution down upon the enemies of her faith, consigning their souls to the sacrificial flames. An immolator has the following class features.<br /><br />Servant of the Flame: An immolator must worship a deity whose portfolio includes the Fire domain. An immolator who selects the Fire domain (or one of its associated subdomains, if available) uses her domain powers at +1 caster level (this stacks with the ifrit&rsquo;s fire affinity racial trait).<br /><br />Judgment (Su): An immolator gains the following judgment instead of the smiting judgment.<br /><br />Immolation: The immolator channels purifying flame to consume her enemies. When dealing fire damage to an opponent, she treats the target&rsquo;s fire resistance as 5 lower than normal (minimum 0). At 6th level, she treats the target&rsquo;s resistance as 10 lower than normal, 15 lower than normal at 11th level, and 20 lower than normal at 16th level.<br /><br />Burnt Offering (Su): At 5th level, as a swift action, an immolator can imbue one of her weapons with the flaming weapon special ability. Any creature slain by this weapon burns with magical flame; its body turns to ash, though its equipment is not harmed. This special ability only functions while the immolator wields the weapon. This ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the immolator&rsquo;s level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. At 12th level, this ability gives the immolator&rsquo;s weapon the flaming burst weapon special ability. This ability replaces bane and greater bane.<br /><br />Judgment by Fire (Su): At 20th level, an immolator can call fiery judgment down upon a foe during combat. Whenever an immolator uses her judgment ability, she can invoke a judgment by fire on a foe as a swift action. Once declared, the immolator can make a single melee (or ranged attack, if the foe is within 30 feet) against the target. If the attack hits, the attack deals fire damage instead of weapon damage, and the target must make a successful Fortitude save or die (creatures immune to fire do not have to save). The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the immolator&rsquo;s level + the immolator&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier. Regardless of whether the save is successful, the target creature is immune to the immolator&rsquo;s judgment by fire ability for 24 hours. Creatures killed in this manner explode in a burst of fire, dealing 10d6 points of fire damage to every creature within 5 feet (Reflex save for half damage, DC 10 + 1/2 the immolator&rsquo;s level + the immolator&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier). Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds. This ability modifies and functions as true judgment.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Inquisitor","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-red.jpg","_id":"WYHAA8gCWXbAQZpW"}

These deities all have organized churches beneath the waves that engage zealous followers to hunt down apostates and enemies. Regardless of their faith, these undersea zealots are known as keepers of the current.<br /><br />Underwater Hunter (Ex): Tracking creatures underwater is particularly challenging, but a keeper of the current can read traces of eddies in the water to follow her prey. A keeper of the current adds her level as a bonus on Survival checks to follow creatures underwater. She gains no bonus when finding or following tracks out of the water. Rules for using the Survival skill underwater are on page 47 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures.<br /><br />This ability replaces track.<br /><br />Marine Magic: At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a keeper of the current can learn a spell with the water descriptor from the cleric, druid, inquisitor, or wizard spell list in place of a spell she already knows.

Starting at 1st level, a cloaked wolf receives a morale bonus on all Disguise and Sleight of Hand checks equal to half her inquisitor level (minimum +1). When a cloaked wolf uses Sleight of Hand to draw a hidden weapon, this bonus doubles.<br /><br />This ability replaces stern gaze.<br /><br />Always Wary (Ex): A cloaked wolf is always ready for betrayal and subterfuge. Whenever she attempts a Sense Motive check to avoid being surprised by a foe using Bluff to conceal the attack, the cloaked wolf can always act during the surprise round, regardless of the result of the check.

As a full-round action while standing in a square that a creature occupied when it cast a conjuration (teleportation) spell or spell-like ability, the cold iron warden may attempt a Survival check (DC 10 + the teleportation spell&rsquo;s caster level) to sense the direction of the creature&rsquo;s destination as well as whether the destination lies within 25 feet, 100 feet, 1,000 feet, or more than 1,000 feet of her. She must use this ability within a number of rounds after the creature&rsquo;s teleportation equal to 1/2 her inquisitor level, after which the trail goes cold. A cold iron warden may use this ability once per day plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels she has beyond 2nd.<br /><br />At 12th level, if the cold iron warden exceeds the Survival check DC by 5 or more, she can also sense the creature&rsquo;s location as if using the locate creature spell, using her inquisitor level as the caster level. At 18th level, if the cold iron warden exceeds the Survival check DC by 10 or more, she can also sense the creature&rsquo;s location as if she had cast discern location. This ability replaces track and the teamwork feats gained at 12th and 18th level.<br /><br />Abyssal Scourge (Su): At 3rd level, a cold iron warden gains Alignment Channel as a bonus feat and must choose either chaotic or evil outsiders. She can channel energy as a cleric of her inquisitor level &ndash; 2 a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier, but only to use Alignment Channel to damage outsiders. The DC of the Will save to halve the damage is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor&rsquo;s level + the inquisitor&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. At 6th level, the energy lingers in the affected area for 1 round as a shimmering, barely perceptible, mist that disrupts Abyssal magic. A creature in the mist that casts a conjuration (summoning) spell or spell-like ability with the selected alignment subtype must succeed at a concentration check or lose the spell. At 15th level, any chaotic or evil creature that casts a conjuration (teleportation) spell or spell-like ability while in the mist must succeed at a concentration check or lose the spell. The concentration check DC for both abilities is equal to 15 + double the level of the conjuration spell.<br /><br />A cold iron warden can take other feats to add to this ability such as Improved Channeling, but not feats that alter this ability, such as Command Undead. This ability replaces solo tactics and the teamwork feats gained at 6th and 15th level.<br /><br />Favored Judgment: At 3rd level, the inquisitor gains Favored Judgment (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 150) as a bonus feat but must choose either outsider (chaotic) or outsider (evil). At 9th level, she gains Favored Judgment as a bonus feat a second time and must choose either outsider (chaotic) or outsider (evil). This ability replaces the teamwork feats gained at 3rd and 9th level.<br /><br />Bane (Su): A cold iron warden reduces the amount of bonus damage dealt when using her bane ability against creatures that are not outsiders with the chaotic or evil subtype by 1d6. She increases the amount of bonus damage by 1d6 when she selects outsiders with the chaotic or evil subtype. This ability modifies the bane ability.<br /><br />Translate Telepathy (Su): At 5th level, an inquisitor can sense when a creature within 5 feet of her receives or sends a telepathic message. The distance at which she can detect telepathic messages increases by 5 feet for every 5 additional inquisitor levels she has beyond 5th level, to a maximum of 20 feet at 20th level. By making a Perception check (DC 15 + the highest CR of the creatures using telepathy) as an immediate action, she may listen to all telepathic messages sent to and by creatures in this area for a number of rounds per day equal to her inquisitor level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

This ability replaces greater bane. <br /><br />Aura of Reversion (Su): At 16th level, while using her judgment, an exarch can project a 30-foot-radius emanation for a number of rounds per day equal to her inquisitor level.

Continuous effects from permanent magical items do not cause this effect. Within the aura, dispel checks against transmutation effects gain a +4 bonus.

It takes her 1d3 &times; 10 minutes to conceal or alter evidence in a 10-foot-by-10-foot area. She uses Disguise to alter evidence or Stealth to conceal it, though bonuses and penalties based on her abilities or effects that disguise or hide her own body (such as from disguise self, a cloak of elvenkind, or the size modifier on Stealth checks) do not apply. A creature attempting to investigate the scene using Perception must succeed at the original Perception DC or a DC equal to the traceless operative&rsquo;s check, whichever is higher, in order to discover the true evidence. A creature who fails against a traceless operative&rsquo;s Disguise check potentially also derives the false evidence planted by the traceless operative.<br /><br />This ability replaces monster lore and stern gaze.<br /><br />Trackless (Sp): At 2nd level, a traceless operative&rsquo;s deity helps obscure her path from others. The DC to track the traceless operative (or a group including her) increases by half her inquisitor level. This does not stack with similar abilities, such as a transporter&rsquo;s trailbreaker ability.<br /><br />This ability replaces track.<br /><br />Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 5th level, a traceless operative can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A traceless operative with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her. If the traceless operative already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.<br /><br />This ability replaces bane.<br /><br />Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 12th level, a traceless operative can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the traceless operative by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least 4 more rogue levels (or levels in a class that grants the sneak attack class ability) than the traceless operative has inquisitor levels.

Those inquisitors known as suit seekers take grave offense at the misuse of this ancient power, and dedicate their considerable skills to hunting and eliminating any who would abuse the harrow&rsquo;s magic and the heritage it represents. No two suit seekers seem to share the same vision, though, and so most of these harrow-wielding inquisitors end up at odds with other diviners throughout Avistan and even one another.<br /><br />Alignment: A suit seeker&rsquo;s alignment must be neutral on the good-evil axis, the lawful-chaotic axis, or both.<br /><br />Class Skills: The suit seeker removes Knowledge (dungeoneering), Ride, and Survival from the inquisitor&rsquo;s list of class skills, and adds Knowledge (history) and Use Magic Device to the list.<br /><br />Domain: A suit seeker must select the Knowledge or Luck domain; the Memory or Fate subdomain; or the Fate, Fervor, or Illumination inquisition (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 41&ndash;42).<br /><br />Improvised Array (Su): The suit seeker can call upon the harrow to help her choose an appropriate judgment and bolster her effectiveness with that judgment. As part of activating her judgment ability, the suit seeker can draw an impromptu array of two cards from a complete harrow deck she owns. Once drawn, the array remains the same until the judgment effect ends, though the inquisitor can change her judgment at any time as a swift action, as normal. The act of drawing an improvised array requires a free hand, though the suit seeker can keep a drawn array in her belt or otherwise on her person to perform actions with both hands while still maintaining the cards&rsquo; benefits.<br /><br />At 1st level, as long as the suit seeker has at least one card in her improvised array that matches her current judgment, she increases her effective inquisitor level by a number of levels equal to the number of matching cards for the purpose of determining that judgment&rsquo;s effects. At 8th level, when a suit seeker gains her second judgment, she can forgo pronouncing a second judgment and instead draw four cards for her improvised array. At 16th level, she can forgo pronouncing a second and third judgment and instead draw up to six cards for her improvised array, or she can forgo only her third judgment and draw an array of four cards.<br /><br />In addition to increasing her effective inquisitor level for the purpose of the corresponding judgment, a suit seeker with three or more cards of the same suit in her improvised array gains immunity to ability damage to the corresponding ability score. A suit seeker with five or more cards of the same suit in her improvised array gains a +4 enhancement bonus to the corresponding ability score. These benefits last until the suit seeker&rsquo;s judgment effect ends.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Suit</td>\n<td>Judgment</td>\n<td>Ability</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Books</td>\n<td>Piercing</td>\n<td>Intelligence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crowns</td>\n<td>Smiting</td>\n<td>Charisma</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hammers</td>\n<td>Destruction</td>\n<td>Strength</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Keys</td>\n<td>Protection</td>\n<td>Dexterity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shields</td>\n<td>Resiliency</td>\n<td>Constitution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stars</td>\n<td>Healing</td>\n<td>Wisdom</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />A suit seeker does not gain access to and cannot use the justice, resistance, or purity judgments. A suit seeker makes the following adjustments to her judgments.<br /><br />Smiting: At 6th level, while the suit seeker has her smiting judgment active, her weapons can only count as an alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction if the selected alignment is represented on one of the suit seeker&rsquo;s cards in her current improvised array. If multiple alignments are represented in the improvised array, the suit seeker must select one. If the array contains only neutral cards, the suit seeker cannot benefit from this judgment. She can change the alignment of her judgment to another alignment represented in the array as a swift action.<br /><br />Resiliency: At 10th level, the DR provided by this judgment can change from magic to an alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) only if the selected alignment is represented on one of the suit seeker&rsquo;s cards in her current improvised array. If multiple alignments are represented in the improvised array, the suit seeker must select one. If the array contains only neutral cards, the suit seeker cannot benefit from this judgment. She can change the alignment of this judgment to another alignment represented in the array as a swift action.<br /><br />This ability modifies judgment, second judgment, and third judgment.<br /><br />Eye of the Harrow (Su): At 2nd level, a suit seeker can use the magic of her improvised array to hone her attacks against targets that match the cards&rsquo; alignment. If any of the cards in her improvised array matches the alignment of an enemy creature within 60 feet on either the good-evil axis or the lawful-chaotic axis, the card glows faintly and the inquisitor gains a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls against enemies of the matching alignment as long as the card is in her array. If a card matches the alignment of an enemy within 60 feet on both alignment axes, the card glows brightly and the inquisitor gains a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against enemies of the matching alignment.<br /><br />This ability replaces detect alignment.<br /><br />Unravel Array (Su): At 20th level, a suit seeker can tear apart a target&rsquo;s place in destiny, rendering the creature immobile or possibly dead. As long as she has an improvised array drawn, the suit seeker can destroy one of the cards in her array and designate a single creature within 30 feet as the target of the harrow&rsquo;s magic. The designated creature must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor&rsquo;s level + the inquisitor&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier) or one of its ability scores is immediately reduced to 0, which can immobilize, render unconscious, or kill the creature. The ability score reduced corresponds to the ability score of the card destroyed.<br /><br />Regardless of whether or not the target succeeds at its save, it becomes immune to the inquisitor&rsquo;s unravel array ability for 24 hours. Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds. The destroyed harrow card is removed from the harrow deck. The suit seeker can continue to use the reduced deck for the purpose of her suit seeker powers as long as she wants, though she has no chance of drawing the destroyed card until she purchases a new harrow deck.<br /><br />This ability replaces true judgment.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Inquisitor","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-red.jpg","_id":"oozkLNhenL3YplgR"}

She spends her life hunting and slaying those vampiric monsters for whom humans have become prey. A kinslayer has the following class features.<br /><br />Judgment (Su): At 1st level, a kinslayer gains the following judgment. <br /><br />Slayer&rsquo;s Brand (Su): When using this judgment, the kinslayer gains the ability to brand undead creatures with positive energy. To do so, she must make a successful melee touch attack against the undead creature. This attack deals an amount of positive energy damage equal to 1d6 + the kinslayer&rsquo;s Charisma modifier, and burns her personal symbol into the undead creature&rsquo;s flesh, bone, or even its incorporeal form. From that point onward, the kinslayer can sense the existence of the branded creature as if it were the target of a locate creature spell (caster level equal to 1/2 the kinslayer&rsquo;s inquisitor level). A slayer&rsquo;s brand lasts until the undead creature is destroyed or until the kinslayer uses this ability on another creature. This ability replaces the destruction judgment.<br /><br />Greater Brand (Su): A 1st level, a kinslayer learns to modify her slayer&rsquo;s brand judgment as she gains levels. Whenever she gains the ability to learn a teamwork feat, she can instead opt to learn one of the following modifications to her slayer&rsquo;s brand judgment. <br /><br />Branding Ray: The slayer&rsquo;s brand judgment can be used as a ranged touch attack with a range of 20 feet. A kinslayer can take this modification more than once. Whenever she does, she increases the range of her brand by 20 feet. <br /><br />Debilitating Brand: A creature currently affected by the slayer&rsquo;s brand judgment takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls against the kinslayer who placed the brand. <br /><br />Devastating Brand: When the kinslayer attacks a creature that she has branded with her slayer&rsquo;s brand, she threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19&ndash;20. If the kinslayer is good, she also gains a +2 sacred bonus on all rolls to confirm critical hits on a branded creature. <br /><br />Dual Brand: The kinslayer can have up to two creatures branded at a time. <br /><br />Holy Brand: The kinslayer can use her brand on creatures with the evil subtype as well as undead. <br /><br />Searing Brand: The kinslayer&rsquo;s slayer&rsquo;s brand deals an additional 1d6 points of damage for every five inquisitor levels she has. If the creature hit with the slayer&rsquo;s brand is particularly vulnerable to bright light, the damage dice of her slayer&rsquo;s brand increases to d8s. A kinslayer must be at least 6th level to take this modification. <br /><br />Silver Brand: The kinslayer can use her brand on lycanthropes and creatures with vulnerability to silver as well as undead. <br /><br />Each time the kinslayer opts to take a greater brand, it replaces her ability to gain a teamwork feat at that level.<br /><br />Undead Sense (Sp): At 2nd level, a kinslayer gains the ability to use detect undead as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to the kinslayer&rsquo;s inquisitor level) at will. If she detects the presence of undead, she can use her monster lore ability to attempt to determine the type of undead detected as well as to reveal any strengths or weaknesses the undead might have. If any of the detected undead are vampires, she gains a bonus on the check equal to her inquisitor level to immediately identify them as such. <br /><br />This ability replaces detect alignment.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Inquisitor","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-red.jpg","_id":"sYHfVd5jVyUUteMb"}

These vigilant defenders often work alongside traveling clerics and paladins.<br /><br />Shared Judgments (Su): As a swift action whenever a vigilant defender has pronounced judgment on her foes, she can grant all of her allies the bonus or special ability that the judgment bestows. If she has multiple active judgments, they all affect her allies. When she does this, the judgments no longer affect her, and their effects only last for 1 round, after which that daily use of judgment ends immediately, even if the combat is not over. The vigilant defender cannot change any of these judgments to another type during this round.<br /><br />This ability modifies judgment.<br /><br />Protect the Faithful (Ex): A vigilant defender can spend 1 minute coaching and teaching a group of allies how best to avoid scrutiny from those who wish them harm. The vigilant defender and her allies cannot be in combat or threatened during this coaching, and allies must be able to see and hear the vigilant defender to benefit from this ability. This ability provides no benefits against enemies that have heard or seen the coaching.<br /><br />Affected allies receive a morale bonus equal to 1/4 the vigilant defender&rsquo;s inquisitor level (minimum +1) on all Bluff, Disguise, Perception, and Stealth checks outside of combat made to avoid, deceive, or notice other creatures. This bonus lasts for 10 minutes, and the vigilant defender can affect herself and a number of allies equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).

Many of these inquisitors previously oversaw religious vows in more formal settings, though more pursue more lucrative contracts. Wronged merchants or cheated customers often seek out oathkeepers to bring justice when local authorities fail.<br /><br />Alignment: An oathkeeper must be of a lawful alignment, and her alignment must be within one step of her deity&rsquo;s.<br /><br />This alters the inquisitor&rsquo;s alignment requirements.<br /><br />Class Skills: An oathkeeper removes Knowledge (nature) from her list of class skills and adds Appraise.<br /><br />This alters the inquisitor&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Divine Witness (Su): Every oathkeeper inquisitor develops a unique personal symbol, which she can use to seal an agreement between two or more willing parties. The agreement, whether it&rsquo;s a trade contract, a truce, or a political marriage, must be as detailed as possible and then signed in the oathkeeper&rsquo;s presence by every creature involved. Creatures must sign of their own free will&mdash;any magical or physical coercion will cause the contract to crumble into ash when the oathkeeper attempts to place her seal upon it. So long as no mystic or physical force is influencing any participating creature, the oathkeeper can mystically seal the arrangement with her personal symbol, binding all signing parties into upholding their ends of the bargain for the length of time spelled out in the agreement.<br /><br />Should any oathbound creature break the exact wording of the contract, the agreement is dissolved and the offending creature is cursed, taking a penalty on all d20 rolls equal to the oathkeeper&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier for a number of weeks equal to the oathkeeper&rsquo;s inquisitor level. Furthermore, the inquisitor&rsquo;s symbol appears as a mystic symbol on the offending creature&rsquo;s throat and hands, allowing the oathkeeper to know the creature&rsquo;s location at all times, as per the discern location spell.<br /><br />If a creature is forced into breaking the agreement by magic or overwhelming physical force (for example, breaking an agreement not to harm via a compulsion spell or by physically hurling an oathbound creature to deal damage to another), then the agreement dissipates harmlessly. The oathkeeper&rsquo;s curse is a curse effect, but it can be removed only with a miracle or wish spell.<br /><br />This replaces monster lore.<br /><br />Oathbreaker&rsquo;s Scourge (Su): At 2nd level, if an oathkeeper is given physical evidence of a broken agreement and asked to hunt down the contract&rsquo;s breaker by the offended party, the oathkeeper gains a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Diplomacy and Survival skill checks to gather information about and track the target. The inquisitor is also treated as being 3 levels higher for the purpose of one judgment she uses against the deal breaker, so long as she keeps possession of the evidence. If the oathkeeper uses oathbreaker&rsquo;s scourge when attacking someone who is actually innocent of fraud&mdash;due to forgery, hasty judgments, or other deceptions&mdash;she loses access to all of her oathkeeper archetype abilities for 1 month or until she is the target of an atonement spell. This replaces track.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Inquisitor","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-red.jpg","_id":"wnm8VYx556yajRrP"}

She can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier as per a cleric with an effective level equal to her inquisitor level, but only to harm or turn evil outsiders or undead (treating all evil outsiders as undead creatures for the purpose of determining whether they can be affected by Turn Undead). She can take other feats that add to this ability, such as Extra Channel or Improved Channel, but not other feats that fundamentally alter this ability, such as Elemental Channel, and she cannot select Alignment Channel multiple times. The DC to save against this ability is equal to 10 + 1/2 the expulsionist&rsquo;s inquisitor level + her Charisma modifier. <br /><br />At 8th level, an expulsionist can expend one use of her channel energy ability to attempt to force a possessing creature from its host body. The expulsionist must make a melee touch attack against the possessed creature; if successful, the expulsionist deals damage to the possessing creature as if it were targeted by the expulsionist&rsquo;s channel energy ability (regardless of the possessing creature&rsquo;s creature type), and the possession effect ceases as the possessing creature is ejected from the host body. A successful Will save (DC = the expulsionist&rsquo;s channel energy DC) halves the damage taken and negates the expulsion. <br /><br />This ability replaces domain. <br /><br />Expulsionist Lore (Ex): At 1st level, an expulsionist gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her inquisitor level (minimum +1) on skill checks to notice haunts and incorporeal creatures; on Knowledge (religion) checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of haunts and incorporeal creatures; and on Sense Motive checks to determine whether a creature is possessed, under the effects of an enchantment or curse, or otherwise magically controlled. <br /><br />This ability replaces monster lore. <br /><br />Spirit Sleuth (Ex) : At 5th level, upon interacting with a rejuvenating undead (such as a ghost) or haunt for the first time (such as by attacking the ghost or channeling energy to damage the haunt), an expulsionist can attempt a Sense Motive check as a free action to determine the specific course of action required to permanently neutralize the spirit of haunt (DC = 20 + the target&rsquo;s CR). <br /><br />This ability replaces discern lies.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Inquisitor","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-red.jpg","_id":"xKKhhhpGCvs8bjjt"}

This ability replaces monster lore. <br /><br />Knowledgeable Defense: At 2nd level, a witch hunter who identifies a spell with Spellcraft gains a bonus against its effects, either a +1 bonus on saving throws or a +1 dodge bonus to AC against this spell. This bonus increases every four levels (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). At 20th level, once per day as a swift action, she can grant this bonus to all her allies within 60 feet, for 1 minute. The allies gain the bonus when the witch hunter identifies the spell, and those among the allies who have at least 1 rank in Spellcraft can aid the witch hunter&rsquo;s next Spellcraft check as a swift action while under the effect of this ability. This ability replaces detect alignment, discern lies, and true judgment. <br /><br />Spell Scent: At 6th level, the witch hunter learns how to sense unique spell signatures, and can follow the trail of a cast spell or spell effect cast back to its source. Once per day, when the witch hunter comes into contact with or is exposed to a spell effect or a magic item, she can spend a full-round action to examine the spell effect or magic item, and then gains the effect of a locate creature spell. She can do this even if the spell effect was instantaneous, but must start her examination within 1 round after she experienced the spell&rsquo;s effect. Instead of locating a known creature, the witch hunter locates the caster of the spell effect or magic item she examined. Doing so does not allow the witch hunter to gain any intelligence about the spellcaster other than its location. This ability replaces track.<br /><br />Witch&rsquo;s Bane Judgment (Ex): At 14th level, a witch hunter gains the following judgment.<br /><br />Witch&rsquo;s Bane: Any creature that casts an arcane spell within 30 feet of the witch hunter takes a &ndash;2 penalty to AC against her attacks and a &ndash;2 penalty on saving throws against her spells while this judgment remains in effect.

She can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level and every 2 inquisitor levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing her to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). A monster tactician cannot have more than one summon monster spell active in this way at a time; if she uses another, any existing summon monster immediately ends. These summon monster spells are considered to be part of the monster tactician&rsquo;s spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, she can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic items she creates, so long as she can use this ability to cast the required spells.<br /><br />At 2nd level and each level thereafter, the monster tactician can add one monster from the expanded summon monster list (see pages 28&ndash;29) to her list of available summoned creatures. She can add a new option to any summon monster spell she can cast at the time she chooses the monster; once made, these choices cannot be changed.<br /><br />This ability replaces judgment.<br /><br />Summon Tactics (Su): At 5th level, every time a monster tactician casts a summoning spell, she can choose any one teamwork feat she knows. All creatures summoned by the spell are treated as if they had the chosen feat for all purposes, without needing to meet any prerequisites. At 8th level and again at 16th level, the number of teamwork feats that she can choose when casting a summoning spell increases by 1. She cannot choose the same feat twice. At 20th level, all creatures summoned by the spell are treated as if they knew all of the monster tactician&rsquo;s teamwork feats. This ability replaces discern lies, second judgment, third judgment, slayer, and true judgment.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Inquisitor","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-red.jpg","_id":"zuhvlYqoON2KOgSa"}
