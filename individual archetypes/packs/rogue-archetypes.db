Gun smugglers are adept at procuring firearms and concealing their secret weapons.<br /><br />Weapon Proficiency: A gun smuggler is proficient with all simple weapons and one-handed firearms, plus the rapier, sap, short sword, and sword cane.<br /><br />This replaces the rogue&rsquo;s weapon proficiencies.<br /><br />Hidden Gun (Ex): A gun smuggler gains a bonus equal to half her rogue level on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal a one-handed firearm on her body. She increases the DCs of opponents&rsquo; Perception checks to realize the true nature of disguised weapons (such as a sword cane) within 5 feet of her by an amount equal to her rogue level (maximum DC 25 plus her rogue level).<br /><br />This replaces trapfinding.<br /><br />Secret Sidearm (Ex): As an expert in discreet and easily concealable weapons and firearms, a gun smuggler gains a battered gun identical to that gained by a 1st-level gunslinger and Gunsmithing as a bonus feat (including the ability to restore her battered gun as if she were a gunslinger), though she must select a coat pistol, dagger pistol, or sword cane pistol as her battered weapon.<br /><br />Selective Targeting (Ex): A gun smuggler focuses on concealable firearms for her sneak attacks. When she makes a sneak attack using any weapon other than a coat pistol, dagger pistol, or sword cane pistol (either firing the weapon or making a melee attack), her sneak attack damage dice are d4s instead of d6s.<br /><br />This alters sneak attack.<br /><br />Stolen Shots (Ex): At 3rd level, a gun smuggler can access small quantities of cutting-edge firearm technology through clandestine dealers. She gains the benefits of the black market connections rogue talent, though only for the purpose of securing firearms and related equipment. At the beginning of each day, the gun smuggler gains a number of bullets (with accompanying black powder) or paper cartridges&mdash;referred to as shots&mdash;in any combination equal to her rogue level, representing ammunition smuggled to her by contacts. Her contacts provide only enough shots to replenish this small supply, so she can&rsquo;t accumulate ammunition indefinitely, and these shots have a market price of 0 gp.<br /><br />At 6th level, the gun smuggler can elect to gain one or more pieces of magic ammunition, though each one replaces a number of her daily shots equal to the ammunition&rsquo;s enhancement bonus (maximum enhancement bonus of +2 for any one piece of ammunition). She can choose to add any of the following weapon special abilities to the shot, though the shot must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus, and these special abilities use an amount of bonus equal to the ability&rsquo;s normal price:&nbsp;distance,&nbsp;flaming,&nbsp;flaming burst,&nbsp;merciful,&nbsp;seeking, or&nbsp;thundering. At 9th level and every 3 rogue levels thereafter, the maximum enhancement bonus of a gun smuggler&rsquo;s shots increases by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).<br /><br />This replaces trap sense and the rogue talent gained at 6th level.<br /><br />Uncanny Aim (Ex): At 4th level, a gun smuggler increases the range increment of any coat pistol, dagger pistol, or sword cane pistol she wields by 10 feet. At 8th level, the base damage of bullets fired by these weapons increases by one die step.<br /><br />This replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Rogue","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/lockpick.jpg","_id":"2CG4HTehNQdtI5LB"}

At 8th level, these bonuses increase to +4 and +6, respectively.<br /><br />This replaces evasion.<br /><br />Subtle Poisoning (Ex): At 4th level, a needler can apply a contact or ingested poison to her weapon and deliver it as if it were an injury poison. The poison must be delivered within 1 minute of this application, or it is wasted. The DC of the saving throw to resist the poison decreases by 1 when the needler uses this ability to deliver a contact or ingested poison via injury.<br /><br />This replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Needle Poisoner (Ex): At 6th level, a needler can apply a dose of poison to a weapon as a swift action. This ability counts as swift poisoning for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.<br /><br />This replaces the rogue talent gained at 6th level.<br /><br />Concealed Delivery (Ex): At 8th level, a needler learns how to deliver all types of poisons with subtlety. As a standard action, she can deliver an ingested or inhaled poison to a creature within reach by placing a dose of poison on the target&rsquo;s lips, on the target&rsquo;s neck, or through other similar contact with the target&rsquo;s skin as if the poison were a contact poison. Delivering poison in this way requires a successful Sleight of Hand check opposed by the target&rsquo;s Perception check.

Other consiglieres prefer to work as independent operators and sell their advice and expertise to the highest bidder. Though some consiglieres insulate themselves from violence and criminal activities, many enjoy getting their hands dirty leading strike teams or gangs of hardened thugs.<br /><br />Class Skills: A consigliere adds Knowledge (nobility) to his list of class skills, instead of Knowledge (dungeoneering).<br /><br />This alters the rogue&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Convincing Attitude (Ex): At 1st level, a consigliere gains Persuasive as a bonus feat.

Sometimes a smuggler&rsquo;s cargo is illegal goods, such as drugs or slaves. Other times, a smuggler hides legal goods to avoid paying duties or taxes, and some may even use their abilities to help smuggle escaped slaves to freedom. Smugglers may work on a ship that does nothing but smuggle goods from one port to another, or they may freelance, working on ships that require a smuggler&rsquo;s services for a short time.<br /><br />Bribery: An experienced smuggler knows how to smooth over interactions with customs officials. At 3rd level, when dealing with officials working at a checkpoint, conducting an inspection, or performing another such activity, a smuggler can make a Diplomacy check opposed by the presiding official&rsquo;s Sense Motive check to ensure her contraband makes it through. She gains a +1 bonus on this Diplomacy check. On a successful check, the smuggler pays a small bribe (5d4 gp) to guarantee her cargo remains undisturbed.

At 2nd level, a smuggler may make a Bluff check opposed by a searcher&rsquo;s Perception check when a searcher looks for items the smuggler has concealed.

Though not spellcasters, sylvan tricksters learn minor magical abilities reminiscent of those favored by fey creatures. The journey for many sylvan tricksters began in childhood, learning at an elder&rsquo;s knee the stories of the fey and the secrets of how to resist their tricks. Sylvan tricksters often live in areas where the boundary with the First World is thin, and a few have even been there&mdash; voluntarily or not.<br /><br />Class Skills: A sylvan trickster adds Knowledge (nature) to her list of class skills and learns Sylvan as a bonus language.

This ability replaces trapfinding.<br /><br />False Sensitivity (Ex): At 2nd level, a charlatan can convincingly fake the ability to use occult skill unlocks such as automatic writing and dowsing. An untrained onlooker can&rsquo;t tell the difference between the false medium&rsquo;s scams and a true use of occult skill unlocks. An onlooker capable of using the particular occult skill unlock that the false medium is faking can attempt the appropriate skill check for that unlock, opposed by the false medium&rsquo;s Bluff check, to detect the fraud. In any case, any results of the false medium&rsquo;s charades are fabricated (for instance, the false medium might ask leading questions to elicit false memories while pretending to use hypnotism). This ability replaces the 2nd-level rogue talent.<br /><br />Haunting Presences (Ex): At 3rd level, the false medium exploits his natural talent for deception to convince others of the presence of false supernatural entities. As long as the false medium is in conditions of dim light or darkness, he can use Bluff skill checks to emulate the effects of&nbsp;dancing lights,&nbsp;ghost sound,&nbsp;silent image, or&nbsp;ventriloquism&nbsp;by throwing his voice, subtly misdirecting or convincing subjects, or manipulating light and shadows. The range of these effects is 10 feet from the false medium, plus an additional 5 feet for every 3 rogue levels he possesses beyond 3rd. The effects last for 1 round, though they can be maintained with additional checks. Only one of these effects can be created or maintained in a given round. Observers can attempt either a Perception or Sense Motive check (whichever of their bonuses is higher) to oppose this Bluff check; the GM should roll these checks secretly.

When skill and luck aren&rsquo;t enough, cheating is often the best option.<br /><br />Let Fate Decide (Ex): At 1st level, the Sczarni swindler can declare two different actions that rely on different types of rolls or checks, such as attacking a creature (an attack roll) or sneaking past the same creature (a Stealth check). As a standard action, the swindler then uses a random method to choose one of the declared activities, such as flipping a coin, rolling a die, or drawing a harrow card. The specific method doesn&rsquo;t matter as long as there is an equal chance of either activity being chosen. If the swindler then performs the chosen activity within the next round, she gains a luck bonus on the roll type required for that activity&mdash;attack rolls with a specific weapon, a specific skill check, a specific ability check, or a specific saving throw&mdash;equal to half her rogue level (minimum +1) for 1 minute. If the swindler performs any other action (whether declared or not) in the round after using this ability, she becomes shaken for 1 minute instead. The swindler can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This ability replaces trapfinding.<br /><br />Quicker Than the Eye (Ex): At 2nd level, when the Sczarni swindler uses Sleight of Hand, creatures take a penalty on their Perception checks equal to half the swindler&rsquo;s class level to notice the attempt. The swindler also reduces the normal &ndash;20 penalty by an amount equal to her class level when attempting a Sleight of Hand check as a move action instead of as a standard action. Lastly, the swindler can draw hidden weapons or objects from her person as a move action instead of the usual standard action. This ability replaces evasion.<br /><br />Poker Face (Ex): At 3rd level, the Sczarni swindler gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Profession (gambler), and Sense Motive checks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. The Sczarni swindler can also attempt to feint against non-humanoid targets without penalty, though she still takes a &ndash;8 penalty on feint attempts against creatures with animal intelligence and she cannot feint against mindless creatures. This ability replaces trap sense.<br /><br />No Fool (Ex): At 4th level, the Sczarni swindler gains a +1 bonus on Will saving throws. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 4th (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). This ability replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Cheat Fate (Ex): At 8th level, once per day, the Sczarni swindler can reroll any one d20 roll she has just made before the GM has revealed the result. She must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. The swindler can use this ability twice per day at 14th level, and three times per day at 20th.

If she does set off a trap she was attempting to disarm, she adds double her trap sense bonus to avoid the trap. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Distraction (Ex): At 8th level, whenever a burglar is detected while using Stealth, she can immediately attempt a Bluff skill check opposed by the Sense Motive skill of the creature that spotted her.

If she already has darkvision, the range of her darkvision increases by 10 feet. When the shadow walker reaches 3rd level, and every 2 rogue levels thereafter, the range of her darkvision increases by 10 feet. Also at 3rd level, the shadow walker loses the light sensitivity weakness, if she has it. If she has light blindness, she instead treats it as light sensitivity.<br /><br />This ability replaces trapfinding.<br /><br />Illumination Control (Sp): At 3rd level, a shadow walker can manipulate nearby illumination. At the start of each day, a shadow walker gains a number of illumination points equal to half her rogue level and can spend illumination points to use certain spell-like abilities.

She can spend 2 illumination points to cast&nbsp;darkness, and 3 illumination points to cast&nbsp;daylight,&nbsp;deeper darkness, or&nbsp;motes of dusk and dawn&nbsp;(see page 28). These spell-like abilities have a caster level equal to the shadow walker&rsquo;s rogue level. Using these spell-like abilities does not hamper the shadow walker&rsquo;s vision; for example, she can see through the&nbsp;deeper darkness&nbsp;she creates, and does not take penalties for light sensitivity in the area of her own&nbsp;daylight.<br /><br />This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 2nd level and trap sense.<br /><br />Favored Illumination (Su): At 4th level, a shadow walker chooses one illumination level: bright light, normal light, dim light, or darkness (including supernatural darkness). While she is within her chosen illumination level, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Acrobatics, Perception, and Sleight of Hand skill checks, and can take 10 on any Stealth check attempted within that illumination level. When the shadow walker confirms a critical hit with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage while in her chosen illumination level, she regains 1 illumination point (to a maximum of half her rogue level).

At 8th level, the temporary hit points and additional benefits last for a number of minutes equal to the rotdrinker&rsquo;s rogue level.<br /><br />Ingested poisons provide an alchemical bonus equal to the number of consecutive saving throws required to cure the poison (for example, lich dust provides a +2 bonus). An ingested poison that affects Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution grants this bonus on the rotdrinker&rsquo;s damage rolls and Fortitude saving throws. An ingested poison that affects Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma instead grants this bonus on the rotdrinker&rsquo;s attack rolls and Will saving throws. An ingested poison that does not affect any ability scores (such as oil of taggit) grants this bonus to the rotdrinker&rsquo;s AC. If an ingested poison falls into more than one of these categories, the rotdrinker chooses which benefit she receives at the time of ingestion.<br /><br />This replaces improved uncanny dodge and uncanny dodge.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Rogue","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/lockpick.jpg","_id":"H1u0d7z9FliKTrhM"}

Many organizations employ them to cover up activities that might be unpopular&mdash;should they become known to the general populace.<br /><br />This archetype is appropriate for rogues built using either the&nbsp;Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook&nbsp;or&nbsp;Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained.<br /><br />Fast Talker (Ex): A discretion specialist adds half her rogue level (minimum +1) as a bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.<br /><br />This replaces trapfinding.<br /><br />Obfuscation (Su): A discretion specialist is highly skilled at convincing others not to trust their own senses. At 3rd level as a full-round action, the discretion specialist can convince one living creature within 30 feet that up to 5 minutes of its memories from the past hour are unreliable. If the target fails a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the discretion specialist&rsquo;s rogue level + her Intelligence modifier), the target is convinced that those memories didn&rsquo;t happen or that it&rsquo;s confusing the memories with a dream (or is otherwise hazy as to the memories&rsquo; reality). Each hour after the discretion specialist uses this ability, the target can attempt a new Will saving throw to realize that its relevant memories have been tampered with, although not necessarily that the discretion specialist was the originator of the tampering.<br /><br />The discretion specialist can use this ability once per day, and one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she has. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the discretion specialist can obfuscate memories from an additional hour in the past (to a maximum of 6 hours at 18th level).<br /><br />This replaces trap sense (for a core rogue) or danger sense (for an unchained rogue).<br /><br />Evidence Disposal (Sp): A discretion specialist can cover up a corpse&rsquo;s cause of a death&mdash;or dispose of it entirely. At 4th level, the discretion specialist gains the ability to cast&nbsp;dress corpse&nbsp;(Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue&nbsp;212) as a spell-like ability, using her rogue level as her caster level. She can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she has (to a maximum of five times at 20th level).<br /><br />At 12th level, she can spend two uses of this ability to disintegrate a corpse entirely as a full-round action, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust (a disintegrated creature&rsquo;s equipment is unaffected). The target cannot be an undead creature. A corpse disintegrated this way cannot be brought back to life except by&nbsp;resurrection&nbsp;or more powerful magic, including&nbsp;miracle&nbsp;or&nbsp;wish.<br /><br />This replaces the rogue talents gained at 4th and 12th levels.<br /><br />No Loose Ends (Ex): At 4th level, the discretion specialist can prevent opponents from escaping. Opponents damaged by the discretion specialist&rsquo;s sneak attack are unable to take the withdraw action for 1 round, though they can still move as normal.<br /><br />At 8th level, a creature damaged by the discretion specialist&rsquo;s sneak attack is hampered in casting spells of the teleportation subschool (such as&nbsp;dimension door) as well as using methods of magical transport such as&nbsp;shadow walk. A target attempting to cast such a spell before the end of the discretion specialist&rsquo;s next turn must succeed at a concentration check (in addition to any concentration checks required for casting while threatened or other circumstances) or lose the spell. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + half the discretion specialist&rsquo;s rogue level + her Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />This replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Rogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement this archetype: camouflageAPG, charmerAPG, convincing lieUC, honeyed wordsAPG, and quick disguiseAPG.<br /><br />Advanced Talents: The following advanced talents complement this archetype: hide in plain sightUC&nbsp;and master of disguiseAPG.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Rogue","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/lockpick.jpg","_id":"Hee0Q6YvgYxec7pF"}

The shadow scion can travel up to 30 feet per rogue level per day in this fashion, either in a single round or broken up across multiple shadow steps. This movement must be used in increments of at least 5 feet and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Travel through the Shadow Plane is imprecise; when the shadow scion arrives back on the Material Plane, she reenters 1 square off target, as per the rules for thrown splash weapons. If this would place her in an occupied square, she instead arrives in the nearest safe location.

What they lose in independence, they more than make up for in benefits gained due to their association&rsquo;s infrastructure. Guild agents come at all levels of the organization, from a lowly recruit all the way up to the guildmaster himself.<br /><br />Honor Among Thieves (Ex): A guild agent must remain a member in good standing of a thieves&rsquo; guild (he starts at rank 1 with her guild when using the organizational influence system). If the guild agent leaves his guild, he loses all of the abilities granted by this archetype and does not gain their replacements. If he joins a new guild, the guild agent regains his abilities, though depending on how he joins the guild, he may regain his abilities all at once or gradually over time. Even if the guild in question operates in multiple locations, the guild agent chooses a settlement as a base of operations for his own activities.<br /><br />Guild Connections (Ex): At 2nd level, a guild agent gains the black market connectionsUC&nbsp;rogue talent. Furthermore, he can ask his guild for tips about the local scene, granting him a bonus equal to half his rogue level on Knowledge (local) checks and Diplomacy checks to gather information, as long as the information in question pertains to the guild agent&rsquo;s base of operations.<br /><br />At 4th level, the guild agent also gains the gossip collector vigilante social talent and his base of operations counts as his area of renown for the purpose of determining the effects of gossip collector.<br /><br />This ability replaces evasion and uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Pull Rank (Ex): At 8th level, a guild agent has attained sufficient rank to call in lesser guild members to assist him with a job. He can call lesser members of a number and level equal to the number of followers he would have if he had the Leadership feat (including the +2 bonus for his guildhouse), to a maximum of a number of lesser members equal to his rogue level. If the guild agent possesses the Leadership feat, he gains twice as many followers as normal. If he spends a favor, he can combine this with the command team organizational influence benefit to gain even more lesser members for a particularly difficult job. Each time the guild agent uses the lesser members recklessly and gets them killed, he loses at least 1 influence with his guild.<br /><br />This ability replaces improved evasion.<br /><br />Criminal Mastermind (Ex): At 20th level, except in an unusually powerful guild, a guild agent has become the true power behind the guild. The guild agent has built up a nearly worldwide reputation under a particular criminal epithet (such as &ldquo;The Silver Shadow&rdquo;), known by criminals and law enforcement officers everywhere. This works like the renown vigilante social talent except as follows. It applies in all towns and cities on the same continent as the guild agent&rsquo;s base of operations, without requiring him to select a particular settlement. He has only one identity, and only other criminals and members of the underworld treat their attitudes toward the guild agent as one step closer to helpful at all times (rather than while only in his social identity), while the bonus on Intimidate checks applies against everyone at all times (rather than while only in his vigilante identity).<br /><br />This ability replaces master strike.<br /><br />Rogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the guild agent archetype: assault leaderAPG&nbsp;and getaway artistUC&nbsp;(as well as certainty for an unchained rogue).<br /><br />Advanced Talents: The following advanced rogue talents complement the guild agent archetype: getaway masterUC, hunter&rsquo;s surpriseAPG, opportunist, rumormongerUC, and skill mastery.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Rogue","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/lockpick.jpg","_id":"PcnasYUTvUhqCF1I"}

{"name":"Rogue (Toxic Talon)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adventurer's Guide pg. 75</a><br />Twilight Talons might pursue many tasks, from relatively passive information gathering to staging massive coups meant to depose tyrants. A toxic talon, however, is trained and deployed for one very specific purpose: to defeat foes with unusual and potent poisons. After adopting a profession to serve as a cover for his activities, a toxic talon spends resources and time combining easy-to-obtain materials into dangerous toxins to aid in the defense of Andoran. A toxic talon can use rare, complex, slow-release poisons to make a death look like it happened naturally, but sometimes the toxic talon will use specific poisons to cast suspicion on other organizations, stirring internal conflict that other Twilight Talons can use to their advantage.<br /><br />The use of poisons in the defense of a good nation is controversial, and other branches of the Eagle Knights generally disavow the existence of toxic talons among their organization. Many influential leaders among the Eagle Knights, particularly in the Steel Falcons, have pushed to have the practices of the toxic talons banned from use, but these efforts have only pushed the toxic talons into further obscurity. Their role is particularly protected by the Twilight Talons, who sometimes go as far as to outright lie to others in the Eagle Knights about the operations of a toxic talon. At other times, a toxic talon may choose to martyr his freedom by publicly accepting blame for a mission that has had unfortunate public repercussions. In such a case, the toxic talon is not abandoned by his kin&mdash;instead, he is placed on a fair and public trial whose purpose is as much to appease the masses as it is to determine whether any moral lines were crossed. In cases where such a toxic talon is found guilty, he is generally sentenced to hard labor or prison (in which case he often continues to run missions inside of prisons or other fortifications for the Eagle Knights as best suits his talents) or to exile (in which case his role in serving Andoran shifts to one of clandestine missions in other nations). A toxic talon who martyrs his freedom in this way and is then captured again understands that it&rsquo;s unlikely he&rsquo;ll be afforded the same level of support from the Eagle Knights, and that the organization may well disavow any official knowledge of his actions. To a toxic talon, this is all merely a deeper, more significant level of service to the well-being of the nation of Andoran. By serving as a sort of sineater for the rest of the Twilight Talons (and at times, for the other branches of the Eagle Knights), such selfless characters can ensure that the organization survives scandal and public outcry to carry on their good work. In such cases, while public recognition for their deeds may never manifest, their brothers and sisters never forget the toxic talon&rsquo;s sacrifice.<br /><br />Forceful Breath (Ex): A toxic talon is proficient with blowguns instead of hand crossbows. He can use a blowgun without penalty while prone.<br /><br />This alters the rogue&rsquo;s weapon proficiencies.<br /><br />Poison Adept (Ex): A toxic talon is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a projectile weapon. He can apply poison to a projectile as a move action. This counts as the poison use ability for the purposes of qualifying for feats, prestige classes, and other options.<br /><br />This ability replaces trapfinding.<br /><br />Toxin Resistance (Ex): A toxic talon&rsquo;s constant exposure to varied poisons grants him increasing resistance to them. At 3rd level, a toxic talon gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against diseases and poisons, and he gains a +1 bonus on Heal checks to treat diseases and poisons. He also gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks (including when he activates a magic item) to treat or remove poisons and diseases, such as when using remove disease or neutralize poison. Finally, he gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to identify traps that utilize diseases or poisons. These bonuses increase to +2 at 6th level, to +3 at 9th level, to +4 at 12th level, to +5 at 15th level, and to +6 at 18th level.<br /><br />This replaces trap sense.<br /><br />Catalyst (Su): At 4th level, a toxic talon can use secret alchemical techniques to enhance a poison as he applies it to a weapon, increasing the save DC of the poison by 1 (this bonus increases to +2 at 12th level). This increase to the save DC lasts for 1 minute or until the poison is used up, whichever comes first. A toxic talon can use catalyst once per hour.<br /><br />This ability replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Split Toxin (Su): At 8th level, when a toxic talon uses catalyst to enhance poison as he applies it, he can envenom two ranged weapons or units of ammunition simultaneously with the same dose.<br /><br />This ability replaces the rogue&rsquo;s improved uncanny dodge.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Rogue","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/lockpick.jpg","_id":"TdunNqneuIL9Omz0"}

Investigators use their skills to serve the law, often in the employ of nobles or in the pursuit of noble causes. In some cities cabals of investigators work for rulers or bureaucracies, but often an investigator is a free agent who pursues whatever mysteries come across her path. Of course, not all investigators serve the law. Crime lords and guildmasters often have squads of investigators serving their own nefarious purposes.<br /><br />Follow Up (Ex): An investigator can roll twice on any Diplomacy check made to gather information, and receives the information for both results.

She can be a spy, entertainer, assassin, bodyguard, or just an intimate to someone who needs it most. A deadly courtesan has the following class features.<br /><br />Class Skills: At 1st level, a deadly courtesan adds Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (nobility) to her list of class skills and removes Knowledge (dungeoneering) from her list of class skills.<br /><br />Bardic Performance (Su): At 2nd level, a deadly courtesan gains the bardic performance ability and the fascinate bardic performance. Her fascinate DC is 10 + 1/2 her rogue level + her Charisma modifier. She can use this bardic performance for a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier. At each level after 2nd, she can use bardic performance for 1 additional round per day. If the courtesan also has bard levels, she may use these rounds for either class&rsquo;s fascinate bardic performance, and her bard and rogue levels stack for determining her fascinate DC. This ability replaces the rogue trick gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Inspire Competence (Su): At 3rd level, a deadly courtesan can use her bardic performance to inspire competence. The bonus begins at +2 and increases by +1 for every six levels the courtesan has attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 9th and +4 at 15th). This ability replaces all levels of trap sense.<br /><br />Performance Strike (Sp): At 8th level, as a swift action, a deadly courtesan may expend rounds of bardic performance to gain a morale bonus on one attack roll. The amount of the bonus is equal to the number of bardic performance rounds expended (maximum bonus equal to 1/2 her deadly courtesan level).

Unlike an investigator, a snoop can only use inspiration on skill checks, not on attack rolls or saving throws.

Finally, when a heister uses the Escape Artist skill to move through a tight space where her head fits but her shoulders do not (Core Rulebook 95&ndash;96), the DC is 20, instead of 30.<br /><br />This ability replaces uncanny dodge and the rogue talent gained at 4th level.<br /><br />Unseen (Ex): At 8th level, a heister masters hiding in underground and urban terrain.

Though they often face enemies with greater numbers or resources (or both), sly saboteurs have the advantage of knowing the local people and terrain. They might be rebels fighting against a corrupt government, or they might be members of a militia opposing an invading force. Some are environmentalists who sabotage the tools of industry in order to protect unspoiled nature.<br /><br />Class Skills: A sly saboteur adds Survival to her list of class skills instead of Knowledge (dungeoneering).<br /><br />This alters the rogue&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Scamper (Ex): At 3rd level, a sly saboteur can move through 5 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, this distance increases by 5 feet (to a maximum of 30 feet at 18th level). This ability allows the sly saboteur to take a 5-foot step into difficult terrain. This ability applies only when she is wearing light armor or no armor and carrying no more than a light load, and it stacks with the Acrobatic Steps and Nimble Moves feats.<br /><br />This replaces trap sense.<br /><br />Catastrophic Failure (Ex): At 4th level, when a sly saboteur uses Disable Device to rig a device to fail, she can increase the DC of the check by 5. If she does so and succeeds at the check, when the device fails, users take damage equal to the sly saboteur&rsquo;s sneak attack, or they take half that amount with a successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the sly saboteur&rsquo;s level + her Dexterity modifier). The type of damage depends on the nature of the device but is typically bludgeoning, fire, piercing, or slashing.<br /><br />This replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Disable Magic Device (Su): At 8th level, a sly saboteur can use Disable Device to rig a magic item to fail as if it were an extremely complex device. If the item&rsquo;s effect is instantaneous, the effect is countered the next time the item is activated, but the activation still consumes a charge or use. If the item&rsquo;s effect is continuous or has a duration, the effect fails after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use (sly saboteur&rsquo;s choice). This ends the duration or suppresses a continuous effect for 1d4 rounds (as the spell&nbsp;dispel magic).

He excels in exploiting overconfidence and predictability, using knowledge he&rsquo;s gained from his extensive research and field experience combined with hearsay and recent observations to react to problems as soon as they arise with swift but unnaturally accurate guesswork. A scroll scoundrel is often called upon by the Pathfinders to undertake missions where killing a foe isn&rsquo;t nearly as important as humiliating them in public duels or similar conf licts. A scroll scoundrel has the following class features.<br /><br />Fast Talker (Ex): At 2nd level, a scroll scoundrel&rsquo;s penalty on Bluff checks that are unlikely, farfetched, or impossible to achieve is reduced by 5. When he makes a Diplomacy check to adjust a creature&rsquo;s starting attitude, he gains a +3 competence bonus on the skill check. This ability replaces the rogue&rsquo;s 2nd-level rogue talent.<br /><br />Adaptive Learning (Ex): At 3rd level, a scroll scoundrel gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against abilities and spells he has already successfully saved against within the past minute (even if the spells or abilities in question were used by different creatures). This bonus increases by +1 when the scroll scoundrel reaches 6th level, and by an additional +1 for every three levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 18th level. This ability replaces trap sense.<br /><br />Pay it Back (Ex): At 4th level, a scroll scoundrel receives a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against foes who made melee attacks against him in the previous round. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Elusive Gambit (Ex): At 6th level, a scroll scoundrel&rsquo;s movement can leave a foe off-balance. If a scroll scoundrel provokes an attack of opportunity by moving past an opponent and that opponent then misses with the attack, that foe is considered to be f lat-footed against the scroll scoundrel&rsquo;s next melee attack, provided that melee attack comes within 1 round of the missed attack of opportunity. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Spot Weakness (Ex): At 10th level, a scroll scoundrel can discover a weakness in his enemy&rsquo;s defenses as a swift action. His next successful hit in the same round ignores 5 points of the foe&rsquo;s damage reduction or hardness. At 15th level, he ignores the first 10 points, and at 20th level, the first 15 points. If the attack deals any sneak attack damage, he ignores all of the foe&rsquo;s damage reduction or hardness for that attack. He cannot use this ability on foes that are immune to critical hits.

In addition to natural dangers and mundane traps, these locations are often protected by ancient curses or the psychic imprints of former occupants. Though not versed in magic, relic raiders learn to unweave these maledictions as easily as they unlock ancient vaults.<br /><br />Curse Sense (Ex): At 4th level, a relic raider adds 1/2 her rogue level on Perception checks to notice haunts and on Spellcraft checks to identify cursed items (using detect magic or similar effects).<br /><br />In addition, the relic raider gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against curses and haunts and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by haunts. These bonuses increase by 1 at 6th level and every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Disable Curse (Su): At 8th level, a relic raider can attempt to disable a curse as she would a magical trap. This ability acts as&nbsp;remove curse, except instead of a caster level check, the relic raider attempts a Disable Device check (DC = 15 + the DC of the curse). Disabling a curse takes 2d4 rounds, and the relic raider cannot take 10 or 20 on this check. A relic raider can use this ability once per day at 8th level. At 12th level and every 4 rogue levels thereafter, a relic raider can use disable curse one additional time per day. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Advanced Talents: A relic raider can select the following advanced talents. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a rogue&rsquo;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision must be made before making the attack roll.<br /><br />Cursed Strike* (Su): Once per day, when the relic raider would normally deal sneak attack damage, she can instead forgo all bonus damage to attempt to curse her target (as per the spell&nbsp;bestow curse). The save is DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the relic raider&rsquo;s rogue level + her Intelligence modifier. A relic raider must have the major magic rogue talent before choosing cursed strike. The relic raider can use this ability an additional time per day at 15th level and 20th level.<br /><br />Etheric Strike* (Su): With a successful sneak attack against haunts or undead, the relic raider can deal her sneak attack damage as positive energy damage rather than physical damage. The additional damage affects undead that are normally immune to sneak attacks because of their lack of a discernible anatomy (such as ghosts). A relic raider can make an etheric strike a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Rogue","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/lockpick.jpg","_id":"dlWUGkRPoHEQINl4"}

Half-orc rogues leave subtle tactics and finesse to halflings and elves, and rely on brute strength and thuggery when they go about making mischief. Skulking slayers have turned the use of raw strength and surprise into an art form.

This bonus is equal to her number of sneak attack dice for a dirty trick combat maneuver, or 1-1/2 &times; her number of sneak attack dice for a steal combat maneuver.

So long as she has at least two surfaces no farther than 10 feet apart to bounce against, she can ricochet her body back from one to the next, descending great distances with a single check. The DC is 10 + 5 for every additional 10-foot increment descended beyond the initial 10 feet dropped. If she fails, she falls the full distance.

Bandits tend to have a variety of skills; sometimes these skills are similar to a ranger&rsquo;s, but a bandit&rsquo;s tactics always deal with surprise followed by intimidation, with the clear threat of naked force if intimidation does not do the trick. But not all bandits are ruthless thugs. There are those who become outlaws in opposition to tyrants or similar oppressors. These bandits target the status quo and distribute their spoils back into the needy hands of the peasantry.<br /><br />Ambush (Ex): At 4th level, a bandit becomes fully practiced in the art of ambushing. When she acts in the surprise round, she can take a move action, standard action, and swift action during the surprise round, not just a move or standard action. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Fearsome Strike (Ex): At 8th level, a bandit can terrify an opponent with a single hit. A number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1), when a bandit confirms a critical hit and deals sneak attack damage to an opponent, she can choose to make the opponent frightened for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).

Rather than focusing on saving slaves, Bellflower irrigators seek to defeat slavery by aiming to eliminate the source. They gauge the precise moment to strike from the shadows and annihilate slave traders and masters alike. Bellflower irrigators realize that for every slave released today, another will be shackled tomorrow&mdash;until all the masters are dead. This cynicism leads Bellflower irrigators to target anyone who owns or sells slaves on Golarion, especially cruel masters within Cheliax.<br /><br />Though most Bellflower irrigators are halflings, this branch of the Network is more diverse than many of the others&mdash;anyone with a hatred of slavery and a talent for stealth and martial combat is free to join. Bellflower irrigators employ combat methods that many find questionable, such as the use of poison and calculated strikes meant to kill rather than incapacitate. The Bellflower Network does not knowingly allow evil members, but very few Bellflower irrigators are good&mdash;most are chaotic neutral in alignment, as their methods of solving the problem of slavery often force them into moral and ethical gray areas. A few Bellflower irrigators are in fact evil, but these rarities do their best to hide their personal lack of morals and addiction to cruelty in order to maintain their positions and connection to the Bellflowers, for as evil as they may be, they share a hatred of slavery with their more altruistic kin. An evil Bellflower irrigator who is found out is typically exiled from the group, yet most continue to fight slavery even after they are sent away in this way.<br /><br />Bellflower Crop (Ex): As a standard action, a Bellflower irrigator can designate a number of allies equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier as part of his Bellflower crop. Members of a Bellflower crop must remain within 30 feet of the Bellflower irrigator to gain any benefits from abilities that affect a Bellflower crop, regardless of the ability&rsquo;s source (whether it&rsquo;s a Bellflower harvester, irrigator, or tiller). If the allies leave this range, the Bellflower irrigator must designate them again to include them in his crop.<br /><br />Poison Use (Ex): A Bellflower irrigator is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon.<br /><br />This ability replaces trapfinding.<br /><br />Grafting (Ex): At 4th level, a Bellflower irrigator is considered to be flanking an opponent if at least two members of his Bellflower crop are threatening that opponent, regardless of the irrigator&rsquo;s actual positioning.<br /><br />This ability replaces uncanny dodge and the rogue talent gained at 4th level.<br /><br />Irrigation (Ex): At 8th level, if a Bellflower irrigator studies his target for 3 rounds (spending a standard action each round to do so) and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (Bellflower irrigator&rsquo;s choice). The death attack fails if the target detects the Bellflower irrigator or recognizes him as an enemy. If the victim of the attack fails a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Bellflower irrigator&rsquo;s class level + the Bellflower irrigator&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per 2 rogue levels that the Bellflower irrigator has. If the victim&rsquo;s saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the Bellflower irrigator has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the irrigation attempt within the next 3 rounds. A Bellflower irrigator can attempt to kill or paralyze a creature in this way once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 additional rogue levels he has after 8th.<br /><br />This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Rogue","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/lockpick.jpg","_id":"nDBOj7DAIrMyLWS0"}

The trapsmith may have started out putting together traps in order to better understand how to disable them, but for most, it&rsquo;s long since gone beyond that&mdash;they now relish the challenge of creating the perfect combat machine.<br /><br />Careful Disarm (Ex): At 4th level, whenever a trapsmith attempts to disarm a trap using Disable Device, she does not spring the trap unless she fails by 10 or more. If she does set off a trap she was attempting to disarm, she adds double her trap sense bonus to avoid the trap. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Trap Master (Ex): At 8th level, whenever a trapsmith disarms a trap using Disable Device, she can bypass it even if her check did not exceed the DC by 10 or more.

A guerrilla can still use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.<br /><br />This ability replaces trapfinding.<br /><br />Cover of Night (Ex): At 2nd level, a guerrilla learns to use darkness to her advantage. She gains a +5 bonus on Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks while she is in areas of dim light or darkness, and can create mundane disguises in dim light or darkness with a full-round action (instead of the normal 1d3 &times; 10 minutes). Additionally, while in dim light or darkness, if a guerrilla would have concealment, she instead has total concealment.<br /><br />This ability replaces evasion.<br /><br />Secret Messenger (Ex): At 3rd level, a guerrilla gains a +1 bonus on Bluff checks to convey secret messages and on Sense Motive checks to discern secret messages.

Instead, they come from the ranks of the elite, having grown bored with their finery, and seek thrills from acts of daring, skill, and crime. Phantom thieves don&rsquo;t need the money, so they often perform acts such as breaking into a secure vault for the thrill, leaving a calling card rather than robbing the place.<br /><br />Refined Education (Ex): A phantom thief adds Handle Animal, Heal, Ride, Spellcraft, Survival, and all Knowledge skills to her list of class skills. Furthermore, she selects one of her rogue class skills and adds half her rogue level on all skill checks using that skill. At 3rd level and every 2 rogue levels thereafter, she selects an additional rogue class skill and adds half her rogue level on all skill checks using that skill as well. Starting at 4th level, if the phantom thief is an unchained rogue, she gains rogue&rsquo;s edge skill unlocks with each of these skills rather than selecting one skill every 5 levels, and she adds half her rogue level to her number of ranks to determine when she receives a skill unlock (so a 7th level rogue (phantom thief ) with 7 ranks in a chosen skill would count as having 10 ranks and receive the second skill unlock).<br /><br />This ability alters the rogue&rsquo;s class skills and replaces sneak attack and trapfinding. For an unchained rogue, it also alters rogue&rsquo;s edge and replaces debilitating injury.<br /><br />Broad Education (Ex): A phantom thief &rsquo;s broad studies with expensive tutors keep her up to speed in both martial and magical knowledge, as well as in her skills. She can select the combat trick, minor magic, and major magic rogue talents as many times as she likes, and she can select the Skill Focus feat as a rogue talent, also as many times as she likes. Finally, she can select a vigilante social talent instead of a rogue talent, except for social grace and vigilante social talents that would require her to be a craftsman or professional. For the purpose of vigilante social talents, a phantom thief does not have a vigilante identity and is always considered to be in her social identity.<br /><br />This ability alters rogue talent.<br /><br />Social Sense (Ex): At 3rd level, a phantom thief &rsquo;s social sixth sense allows her to avoid danger in social situations and to act first when it breaks out. She receives a +1 bonus on Sense Motive checks to avoid being surprised by a foe, on Bluff checks to surprise a foe, and on initiative checks for surprise rounds that involved Bluff and Sense Motive checks to determine surprise. This bonus increases by 1 at 3rd level and every 3 rogue levels thereafter.<br /><br />This ability replaces trap sense.<br /><br />Master of All (Ex): At 20th level, a phantom thief can reroll any skill check as long as it is a class skill in which she is trained.

Cutpurses are often trained by guilds to collect the guild&rsquo;s tax from local businesses on a daily basis, whether through intimidation or pickpocketing. Some find themselves taking up the mantle of adventurer, and their talents are generally appreciated in this role, but the cutpurse is still the first person her companions look to when an item goes missing.<br /><br />Measure the Mark (Ex): When a cutpurse makes a Sleight of Hand check to take something from a creature, the target makes its Perception check before the rogue makes her Sleight of Hand check, and the rogue knows the Perception check result. She can decide whether or not to make the check based on the results of the target&rsquo;s Perception check. If the rogue elects not to make the check, she can make a Bluff check, opposed by the target&rsquo;s Sense Motive, to prevent the target from noticing the attempt. This ability replaces trapfinding.<br /><br />Stab and Grab (Ex): At 3rd level, as a full-round action, a cutpurse can make an attack and also make a Sleight of Hand check to steal something from the target of the attack. If the attack deals sneak attack damage, the rogue can use Sleight of Hand to take an item from the creature during combat; otherwise this ability can only be used in a surprise round before the target has acted.

A swordmaster has the following class features.<br /><br />Class Skills: The swordmaster adds Knowledge (nature) and Survival to her list of class skills and removes Disguise and Knowledge (dungeoneering) from her list of class skills.<br /><br />Trance (Ex): At 3rd level, a swordmaster learns to focus her martial prowess using an intense meditative trance. Under the influence of a trance, the swordmaster can perform fantastic martial feats. Entering a trance is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The swordmaster can maintain the trance for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Wisdom modifier. At each level beyond 3rd, she can remain in the trance for 1 additional round. She can end her trance as a free action. Following a trance, the swordmaster is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 2 &times; the number of rounds she spent in the trance. A swordmaster cannot enter a new trance while fatigued but can otherwise enter a trance multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a swordmaster falls unconscious, her trance immediately ends.<br /><br />At 3rd level, the swordmaster chooses one trance from the list below. She chooses another trance at 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level. She can only use one type of trance at a time.<br /><br />Crane Trance (Ex): The swordmaster&rsquo;s blade rises and falls with the graceful sweeping arcs of the mountain crane. When in this trance, a swordmaster gains the benefits of the Crane Style feat .<br /><br />Dragon Trance (Ex): Like the dragon, the swordmaster has honed the steadiness of her mind and body. When in this trance, a swordmaster gains the benefits of the Dragon Style feat .<br /><br />Leopard Trance (Ex): Using the swiftness of the leopard, a swordmaster&rsquo;s evasive footwork confuses her opponents. When in this trance, a swordmaster gains the benefits of the Mobility feat.<br /><br />Monkey Trance (Ex): As the monkey springs, the swordmaster leaps from the reach of her enemies. While in this trance, a swordmaster can make an Acrobatics check opposed by an opponent&rsquo;s CMD. If she succeeds, she may move 5 feet as a swift action within the opponent&rsquo;s threatened area; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count as a 5-foot step.<br /><br />Serpent Trance (Ex): Like the serpent, the swordmaster&rsquo;s quick movements allow her to catch her opponent unawares.

The filcher also subtracts her class level from the normal &ndash;20 penalty when attempting to make a Sleight of Hand check as a move action instead of as a standard action. Lastly, the filcher can withdraw an object hidden on her person, including a weapon, as a move action instead of the usual standard action. This ability replaces evasion.<br /><br />Rummage (Ex): At 3rd level, a filcher learns how to assess the value of items at the quickest glance. She can even make startlingly accurate guesses about particular items merely by observing the bulges they make in pouches, backpacks, or similar containers. She gains a +1 bonus on Appraise checks and an additional +1 bonus every three levels thereafter.<br /><br />As a swift action, a filcher can make an Appraise check in order to determine the relative value of each object carried by her target (DC = 10 + 1 for every object the filcher is trying to ascertain the relative value of). Though she never learns the actual prices of items when using rummage, she does gain enough information to list these items in order, from the most valuable to the least valuable. She can, by taking a &ndash;20 penalty on the check, add to this assessment any items carried by her target that she cannot see. This ability replaces trap sense +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, and +6.<br /><br />Filch (Ex): At 4th level, a filcher learns how pluck items off her opponents even in combat. She gains Improved Steal as a bonus feat and can use her Sleight of Hand bonus instead of her CMB when performing a steal combat maneuver. If the filcher gains bonuses on combat maneuver checks from any feats, spells, magic items, or similar effects, they are added to the Sleight of Hand bonus when using the steal maneuver. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Superior Filching (Ex): At 8th level, a filcher becomes a master at separating owners from their property.

Armor sometimes interferes with an eldritch scoundrel&rsquo;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook&nbsp;83). This alters the rogue&rsquo;s armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Class Skills: An eldritch scoundrel gains 4 skill ranks (plus a number of ranks equal to her Intelligence modifier) at each level instead of a normal 8. She gains Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft as class skills, but not Diplomacy and Disguise. This alters the rogue&rsquo;s skills.<br /><br />Spells: An eldritch scoundrel casts arcane spells drawn from the wizard spell list. An eldritch scoundrel must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time. She learns, prepares, and casts spells exactly as a wizard does, including adding new spells to her spellbook and gaining two additional spells known (of any level she can cast) each time she gains a rogue level with this archetype.<br /><br />An eldritch scoundrel can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is the same as the magus class (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic&nbsp;10).<br /><br />Alarm Sense (Su): At 3rd level, an eldritch scoundrel gains an intuitive sense that warns her when she is near a magic trap. This functions as the trap spotter rogue talent, but applies only if the eldritch scoundrel comes within 10 feet of a magic trap. This ability replaces trap sense.<br /><br />Sneak Attack (Ex): The eldritch scoundrel doesn&rsquo;t acquire the sneak attack class feature until 3rd level, when she gains a +1d6 sneak attack. This increases by 1d6 at 7th level, and again at every 4 rogue levels thereafter. This modifies the rogue&rsquo;s normal sneak attack progression.<br /><br />Rogue Talents: At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the eldritch scoundrel gains a rogue or ninja talent for which she meets the prerequisites (treating her rogue level as her ninja level). If a talent requires her to expend points from her ki pool, she can instead expend a spell slot with a spell level equal to the number of ki points she would normally expend. If a talent functions only if she has ki in her ki pool, it functions as long as she still has a spell of 1st level or higher prepared. At 12th level, she can select an advanced talent in place of a rogue talent. This modifies the normal rogue talent progression and advanced talent.<br /><br />Uncanny Training: An eldritch scoundrel does not gain uncanny dodge or improved uncanny dodge. Beginning at 4th level, she can take uncanny dodge instead of a rogue talent. Beginning at 12th level, the eldritch scoundrel can choose to take improved uncanny dodge in place of an advanced talent. This modifies uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Rogue","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/lockpick.jpg","_id":"v3t5oUwYorUO8Uj8"}

While in dungeon and urban environments, she leaves no trail and cannot be tracked, though she can choose to leave behind a trail if she so desires. Furthermore, she can always choose to take 10 when making a Stealth check. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Trap Saboteur (Su): At 8th level, a cat burglar becomes a master of avoiding and manipulating traps and locks. She can attempt to open a lock as a standard action and takes 1/2 the normal amount of time to disable traps (minimum 1 round) . When she has bypassed a trap without disarming it, she can also choose to suppress its trigger for up to 1 minute.

Affecting an unwilling creature or an item it wears or carries requires a successful dirty trick combat maneuver against that creature.

These seekers rarely travel far inland, though they may journey to larger landlocked bodies of water, such as Lake Encarthan, to explore submerged ruins there.<br /><br />Arcana Breaker (Su): Typically, only magical traps survive for long periods underwater, so a seeker of the lost specializes in noticing and disarming such traps.

Each dreamthief bears a focused fragment of emotion, known as a dreamshard, within her soul. Some are born with such fragments, while others gain their dreamshards during traumatic moments, especially those involving nightmares, attacks by ethereal beings, or incidents that take place in the Dimension of Dreams. Whether a dreamshard is shaped from the dreamer&rsquo;s aggregated emotions or manifested from a repressed aspect of herself, this metaphysical crystal grants a dreamthief supernatural powers, which she supplements with skill and grace.<br /><br />Dreamthieves&rsquo; powers grant them enhanced access to dreamscapes. Using the unique power of her dreamshard, a knowledgeable dreamthief can crystallize and steal dreamers&rsquo; deepest emotions. Such theft can alter dreamers in profound ways, whether for better or worse.<br /><br />Skills: Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (planes) are class skills for a dreamthief.<br /><br />This alters the rogue&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Dreamshard Focus (Su): At 1st level, a dreamthief selects an emotional focus from among those available to a spiritualist&rsquo;s phantom. She gains the abilities granted by that emotional focus (with the exception of the focus determining her good saving throws&mdash;she retains the typical rogue saves). For each of the two skills associated with that emotional focus, a dreamthief gains ranks in that skill equal to her rogue level; this does not allow her ranks in these skills to exceed her Hit Dice.<br /><br />A dreamthief is considered to be both a phantom and a spiritualist for the purpose of emotional focus abilities whose effect references both a phantom and a spiritualist, such as dutiful strike, and she treats her rogue level as both her spiritualist level and her phantom Hit Dice when determining abilities and save DCs.<br /><br />Once per round when a dreamthief makes a melee attack, she can declare that attack to be a dreamstrike. This does not require an action, but a dreamthief must declare a dreamstrike before making the attack roll. A dreamstrike is treated as a slam attack for the purpose of emotional focus abilities that apply to a phantom&rsquo;s slam attacks, such as miserable strike. At 20th level, any melee attack a dreamthief makes automatically gains this benefit.<br /><br />This replaces sneak attack and master strike.<br /><br />Lucid Dreamer (Ex): At 3rd level, a dreamthief can control her dreams, and gains Lucid Dreamer as a bonus feat.<br /><br />This replaces trap sense.<br /><br />Soothe Dreaming (Su): At 4th level, a dreamthief can steal negative emotions, freeing allies from harmful conditions. This acts as the mesmerist&rsquo;s touch treatment ability, treating her rogue level as her mesmerist level; a dreamthief can use this ability once per day for every 3 rogue levels she has.<br /><br />This replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Dream Infiltrator (Sp): A dreamthief can enter dreams, whether to learn secrets or meddle more directly. At 8th level, a dreamthief can cast&nbsp;dream scan&nbsp;once per day as a spell-like ability. At 12th level, once per day she can cast either&nbsp;dream scan&nbsp;or&nbsp;dream travel&nbsp;as a spell-like ability. The caster level of these spell-like abilities is equal to her rogue level.<br /><br />This replaces improved uncanny dodge and the rogue talent gained at 12th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Rogue","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/lockpick.jpg","_id":"zrabS86HUrTv6rY4"}
