The vast majority of these secrets were lost when their civilization collapsed, but a few of their magical traditions have been preserved through the years. While the practice of aeromancy is rare, some arcanists today are able to rival the aerial mastery of the ancient Shory aeromancers.<br /><br />Air Mastery (Su): Aeromancers specialize in magic that manipulates the wind and sky. Whenever an aeromancer expends a point from her arcane reservoir to increase the caster level of a spell with the air, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, she increases that bonus by an additional 1. At 5th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the amount by which she increases the caster level of such spells further increases by an additional 1 (to a maximum additional caster level increase from this ability of 5 at 20th level).<br /><br />Alternatively, if the aeromancer expends a point from her arcane reservoir to increase the saving throw DC of a spell with the air, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, she increases it by an additional 1. At 10th level, she increases it by an additional 2 instead.<br /><br />This replaces the arcane exploit gained at 1st level.<br /><br />Wind&rsquo;s Embrace (Su): At 5th level, an aeromancer can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir to call upon the winds to gently carry her through the air while protecting her from harm. She is affected as though by the spell&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=air%20walk\">air walk</a>&nbsp;and is surrounded by protective winds that function similarly to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=wind%20wall\">wind wall</a>&nbsp;spell, except the effect surrounds only the aeromancer and moves with her wherever she goes. Both of these effects last for 1 minute.<br /><br />This replaces the arcane exploit gained at 5th level.<br /><br />Rebuking Gale (Su): At 11th level, by expending 3 points from her arcane reservoir, an aeromancer can release a powerful blast of wind to push back her foes. This takes the form of either a 20-foot-radius burst centered on the aeromancer or a 40-foot cone originating from the aeromancer&rsquo;s space. She can choose which form the wind takes each time she uses the ability. The affected area is filled with hurricane-force winds (75 mph). This makes normal ranged attacks passing through this area impossible, imposes a &ndash;8 penalty on ranged attacks from siege weapons that pass through the area, and imposes a &ndash;12 penalty on Fly checks attempted within the area. Additionally, Large creatures in the area are in danger of being checked, and Medium or smaller creatures in the area are in danger of being blown away. The winds created by this ability last for 1 round.<br /><br />This replaces the arcane exploit gained at 11th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Arcanist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/runes-blue-2.jpg"}

This ability replaces the 1st-level arcanist exploit.<br /><br />Harrow Reservoir (Ex): Once per day, a Harrowed Society student can perform a harrow reading as a 5-minute ritual. She decides which suit most closely aligns with her task at hand and deals a nine-card spread. Each time that suit appears in her spread, she adds 1 point to her arcane reservoir, to a maximum of 1 point per 2 arcanist levels. Points gained in excess of her reservoir&rsquo;s maximum are lost. The Harrowed Society student can perform this reading one additional time per day at 8th level and at 16th level. This ability replaces consume spells.<br /><br />Divine the Mysteries (Ex): At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Harrowed Society student can select a divination spell from the spell list of any class, including classes that cast divine or psychic spells, and add it to her list of spells known. This spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. She casts these spells as arcane spells, using her normal spell slots, but must use a harrow deck as an additional focus component. If such a spell is normally a psychic spell with an emotion or thought component, she must also add that component.<br /><br />Trump Card (Su): At 9th level, a Harrowed Society student can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir and draw a card from her harrow deck as a standard action to learn her own fate or that of an ally within 30 feet. The target&rsquo;s fate depends on the suit of the card drawn from the deck.<br /><br />Books: The target gains a +2 insight bonus on her next caster level check.<br />Crowns: The target gains a +2 insight bonus on her next saving throw.<br />Hammers: The target gains a +4 insight bonus on the damage roll of her next successful melee attack.<br />Keys: The target gains a +4 insight bonus on her next initiative check.<br />Shields: The next time the target receives magical healing, she regains an additional number of hit points equal to the Harrowed Society student&rsquo;s arcanist class level.<br />Stars: The target gains a +4 insight bonus on her next skill check.<br /><br />A creature cannot have more than one trump card in effect at one time; drawing a new trump card for a target negates the effect of the previous trump card. A Harrow Society student can attempt to read the fate of an enemy within 30 feet, resulting in a penalty for that target equal to the bonus granted above, but the target is entitled to a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Harrowed Society student&rsquo;s arcanist level + her Charisma modifier) to negate the effect.

Air grants a fly speed of 90 feet (average maneuverability), earth grants a burrow speed of 30 feet, fire grants a increase of 30 feet to base land speed, and water grants a swim speed of 60 feet.

While the twilight sages generally aren&rsquo;t actively malicious, most are willing to perform human experimentation in pursuit of knowledge with little regard for the casualties.<br /><br />Consume Life (Su): By wresting a soul from life to death, a twilight sage gains a slightly deeper understanding of mortality, fueling her curiosity and eldritch power. As a full-round action, she can consume the life energy of a helpless living creature, killing it. This creature must have 2 or more Hit Dice and be below 0 hit points. The twilight sage adds 2 points to her arcane reservoir if the creature&rsquo;s Hit Dice equaled or exceeded the sage&rsquo;s character level, or 1 point if the creature&rsquo;s Hit Dice equaled at least 1/2 her character level. This ability is a death effect. This ability replaces consume spells.<br /><br />Necromantic Focus (Ex): Twilight sages consider their research into life and death to be paramount, beyond all other concerns. Each day, a twilight sage must prepare at least one necromancy spell of each spell level she can cast.<br /><br />Twilight Barrier (Ex): A twilight sage&rsquo;s arcane barrier differs from those of other arcanists, as it draws upon both negative and positive energy to protect the sage. At 1st level, a twilight sage must choose the arcane barrier exploit as her first arcanist exploit. Whenever an attack removes the last temporary hit point from the twilight sage&rsquo;s arcane barrier, the barrier&rsquo;s negative energy lashes back at the attacker, dealing an amount of negative energy damage equal to the barrier&rsquo;s maximum temporary hit point capacity. This ability alters the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.<br /><br />Twilight Transfer (Su): At 11th level, a twilight sage&rsquo;s mastery over life and death allows her to transfer life energy into a fading vessel. Once per day, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir while touching a creature that died within the past round to affect that creature as if it had received a&nbsp;breath of life&nbsp;spell, using her arcanist level as the caster level. At the same time, a willing or unconscious living creature within 300 feet that has a number of Hit Dice equal to or greater than the recipient&rsquo;s instantly dies. This ability is a death effect, and if the victim doesn&rsquo;t actually die (such as if it was summoned or is immune to death effects), the recipient doesn&rsquo;t receive the&nbsp;breath of life&nbsp;effect. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 11th level.<br /><br />Death&rsquo;s Release (Su): At 20th level, a twilight sage has mastered the relationship between death and arcane power, and has gained a limited ability to surpass her own mortality. Whenever she dies (but not if she becomes undead), if she still has points in her arcane reservoir she appears as an ephemeral spirit in the air above her corpse. She can still cast spells in this form, using her corpse as the origin point and determining whether she can see or target any creature or area as though she were alive in that square. To cast a spell, she must expend a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The spirit disappears if she has no points remaining in her arcane reservoir or she spends a round without casting a spell. The spirit can&rsquo;t move, deliver touch or ranged touch spells, or do anything that isn&rsquo;t part of casting a spell. Her spirit completes the verbal and somatic components of her spells, any material components are consumed from the supply on the corpse, and any focus components must be on the corpse.

Spell specialists are able to warp and twist the magic of their signature spells in ways other casters cannot.<br /><br />Signature Spells: At 1st level and each time a spell specialist gains a new spell level, she chooses a signature spell. The spell specialist can cast this spell without preparing it, in the same way a sorcerer casts spells spontaneously. Even though the spell specialist does not need to prepare this spell, it still counts against the number of spells she can prepare, reducing the number of spells of each level she can prepare each day by 1. A spell specialist can swap out a single signature spell for another spell of the same level when gaining a class level.<br /><br />The DC for signature spells increases by 1. The spell specialist gains a +2 bonus on concentration checks when casting signature spells; this bonus increases to +4 at 10th level. Additionally, a spell specialist can apply one of the following additional effects by spending 1 point from her arcane reservoir.<br /><br />Dismiss (Su): A spell specialist can dismiss a signature spell as a swift action instead of a standard action. Alternatively, the spell specialist can dismiss a signature spell that has a duration but isn&rsquo;t normally dismissible.<br /><br />Spell Bender (Su): The spell specialist can bend the line of a spell that has a line area of effect up to 90 degrees at any single point along the line&rsquo;s length.<br /><br />Spellwarp (Su): A spell specialist can reduce the radius of a spread or burst effect or shorten the length of a cone. All changes must occur in 5-foot increments, to a minimum of 5 feet. Alternatively, the spell specialist can change the area of effect of a cone spell to a line with a length equal to the spell&rsquo;s range.<br /><br />This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st, 7th, 13th, and 19th levels.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Arcanist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/runes-blue-2.jpg"}

They become adept at shaping this magical energy without needing to bind it up in spells.<br /><br />Font of Power: An eldritch font gains one additional spell slot for each level of arcanist spell she can cast. However, the number of spells of each level that she can prepare reduces by 1. If this reduces her spells prepared for a level to 0, she still gains spell slots of that level, which can be consumed using the consume spells class feature to fuel her arcane reservoir or cast spells using metamagic feats.<br /><br />Eldritch Surge (Su): At 3rd level, an eldritch font can, as a swift action, pour more power into her spells and abilities. She can add 2 to the caster level and DC of a spell, or increase her effective arcanist level by 2 when using an arcanist exploit. She becomes fatigued upon using this ability. If she is already fatigued, she becomes exhausted. If she&rsquo;s already exhausted, or something would prevent her from becoming fatigued or exhausted, she cannot use this ability. This ability does not stack with spending points from her arcane reservoir to increase the spell&rsquo;s caster level or DC (as the arcane reservoir class feature). Only rest can remove fatigue or exhaustion caused by an eldritch surge&mdash;spells and abilities have no effect. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level.<br /><br />Improved Surge (Su): At 7th level, an eldritch font can use her eldritch surge ability to reroll an attack roll associated with a spell or arcanist exploit, or to reroll all of the damage dice associated with a spell or arcanist exploit. In the case of attack rolls, this ability must be used after the die is rolled but before the results are revealed. The eldritch font must take the results of the reroll, even if they are lower. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 7th level.<br /><br />Greater Surge (Su): At 13th level, an eldritch font can use her eldritch surge ability to force a creature to reroll a saving throw against one spell or arcanist exploit and take the lower value. The eldritch font must declare the use of this ability before the result of that creature&rsquo;s saving throw is revealed. If the spell or arcanist exploit affects more than one target, only one target is affected by this ability. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 13th level.<br /><br />Bottomless Well: At 20th level, an eldritch font can spend 1 hour studying her spellbook to refuel herself. Doing so allows her to prepare new spells and regain points of arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 her level. She can use this ability multiple times per day, however she still only regains spell slots once per day.

What few realize is that these specialized arcanists excel at turning themselves&mdash;and others&mdash;into all kinds of creatures.<br /><br />Powerful Change (Su): At 3rd level, the brown-fur transmuter learns to harness the power of her magic to empower her transmutations. Whenever the brown-fur transmuter casts a transmutation spell using one of her arcanist spell slots, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action to bolster the spell. If the spell grants a bonus to an ability score, the bonus then increases by 2. If it grants a bonus to more than one ability score, only one of the ability scores gains this bonus. The brownfur transmuter cannot expend more than 1 point from her arcane reservoir in this way.

Those particularly gifted in the art of sculpting spells are sometimes schooled privately in the art of traditional, esoteric, and righteous spells, in the hope that such knowledge will pave the way for the initiate&rsquo;s acceptance into the school proper as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/PrestigeClassesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Magaambyan%20Arcanist\">Magaambyan arcanist</a>.<br /><br />But many initiates find themselves overwhelmed by the extensive training and end up leaving the Magaambya before completing their studies. These spellcasters retain many of the Magaambya&rsquo;s techniques and philosophical bents, but are not considered to be graduates of the school. Yet they are still respected and valued, for the Magaambya&rsquo;s staff fully understand that its teachings and the scholastic, often hermetic lifestyle required to master the techniques are not to everyone&rsquo;s tastes. For the teachers of the Magaambya, there are no truly failed students save those who abandon their philosophy and succumb to the lure of cruelty and evil.<br /><br />Because they hold the Magaambya&rsquo;s interests close to their hearts but are not hindered by the need to remain close at hand to study or serve as teachers or assistants, Magaambyan initiates often serve as strong supporters beyond the normal reach of the Magaambya. Furthermore, Magaambyan initiates can act immediately against the forces of evil without waiting to be officially sent out into the world.<br /><br />Alignment: A Magaambyan initiate must be of a good alignment.<br /><br />This alters the arcanist&rsquo;s alignment.<br /><br />Aura of Good (Ex): A Magaambyan arcanist radiates an aura of good as if she were a cleric of a level equal to her class level (see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=detect%20good\">detect good</a>&nbsp;spell).<br /><br />Halcyon Spell Lore (Su): A Magaambyan initiate&rsquo;s studies of the philanthropic teachings of Old-Mage Jatembe allow her to cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she could normally prepare ahead of time. At each class level, she chooses one spell from the druid spell list or one spell with the good descriptor from the cleric spell list. The spell must be of a spell level that she can cast, and cannot be a spell that already appears on her arcanist spell list. A Magaambyan initiate can cast a spell that she has chosen with this ability as if it were on her spell list and prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to half the spell&rsquo;s level (minimum 1) and expending a spell slot of the spell&rsquo;s level. At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Magaambyan initiate can choose to lose a spell that she has chosen with this ability in exchange for a new spell of the same spell level that meets the same requirements.<br /><br />This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st, 9th, and 17th levels.<br /><br />Spell Mastery: At 5th level, a Magaambyan initiate gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Spell%20Mastery\">Spell Mastery</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. Her arcanist levels count as wizard levels for the purpose of satisfying feat prerequisites, both when selecting this bonus feat and when selecting feats gained from character advancement. If she uses her arcanist level to satisfy the prerequisites for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Spell%20Mastery\">Spell Mastery</a>, she can prepare spells selected with this feat as arcanist spells without referring to a spellbook, but not as wizard spells. The Magaambyan initiate can also select&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Spell%20Mastery\">Spell Mastery</a>&nbsp;as a feat gained from character advancement, allowing her to select the feat multiple times.<br /><br />In addition, if the Magaambyan initiate gains levels in the Magaambyan arcanist prestige class (see page 118), her prestige class levels stack with her arcanist levels when determining the number of points in her arcane reservoir (though not the effectiveness of arcane exploits based on class level). A Magaambyan initiate who takes levels in Magaambyan arcanist and gains the spontaneous spell mastery class feature can use that ability to instantly lose one of her prepared spells and immediately prepare a different arcanist spell of the same level or lower that she has mastered with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Spell%20Mastery\">Spell Mastery</a>, rather than spontaneous spell mastery&rsquo;s normal effect.

At 11th level, a construct is instead treated as if it has spell resistance equal to 11 + the construct&rsquo;s CR.<br /><br />This replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 5th and 11th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Arcanist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/runes-blue-2.jpg"}
