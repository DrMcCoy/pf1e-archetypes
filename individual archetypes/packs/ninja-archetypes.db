The gunpowder bomb deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 10-footradius burst, which can be increased to 20 feet by spending 1 additional ki point. A creature in the bomb&rsquo;s radius can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the gunpowder bombardier&rsquo;s ninja level + her Dexterity modifier) for half damage. At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the bomb&rsquo;s damage increases by 1d6, to a maximum of 9d6 points of bludgeoning damage at 19th level.<br /><br />This alters ki pool and replaces the ninja trick gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Explosive Impairment (Su): At 4th level, a gunpowder bombardier can imbue her gunpowder bombs with impairing effects. By spending 1 additional ki point when she throws a gunpowder bomb, the gunpowder bombardier can cause her bomb to inflict one of the following conditions, in addition to dealing its normal damage, for a number of rounds equal to half her ninja level: dazzled, deafened, entangled, or shaken. At 8th level, she adds nauseated and stunned to the list of conditions her bombs can inflict. A creature that succeeds at the Reflex save to halve the damage also negates the condition inflicted by the gunpowder bomb.<br /><br />This replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Delayed Explosive (Ex): At 8th level, a gunpowder bombardier can plant a gunpowder bomb and delay its explosion. As a standard action, the gunpowder bombardier can place a gunpowder bomb&mdash;adding effects as she would if she were throwing the gunpowder bomb, and spending the requisite ki points&mdash;and specify a number of rounds after which the bomb will detonate, up to a maximum number of rounds equal to the gunpowder bombardier&rsquo;s ninja level. If the bomb is touched or moved by another creature, it detonates immediately. The gunpowder bombardier can have only one delayed explosive active at a time; planting another gunpowder bomb renders the previous bomb inert.<br /><br />This replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ninja","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/kunai.png","_id":"2p3bJtyHKT3XdVDJ"}

A blossom shower lasts for a number of rounds equal to half the petal ninja&rsquo;s level (minimum 1 round).<br /><br />When activating a blossom shower, the petal ninja forgoes a number of sneak attack dice to determine the shower&rsquo;s effects, as noted below. These sneak attack dice are unavailable for the duration of the blossom shower and are regained when the effect ends. If an effect requires a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + twice the number of sneak attack dice expended + the petal ninja&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. The petal ninja can choose to create a lesser effect even if she expends more dice than required. For example, she can expend 4 sneak attack dice, but impart the effect of 3 sneak attack dice. The shower does not affect the petal ninja herself, apart from the concealment granted by using 1 sneak attack die. <br /><br />1 Sneak Attack Die: Creatures within the radius gain concealment (20% miss chance). <br /><br />2 Sneak Attack Dice: As 1 sneak attack die, except each creature in the radius must succeed at a Will save or be dazzled for 1d6 rounds. <br /><br />3 Sneak Attack Dice: As 2 sneak attack dice, except creatures are sickened on a failed save. <br /><br />4 Sneak Attack Dice: As 2 sneak attack dice, except creatures are fascinated on a failed save. <br /><br />5 Sneak Attack Dice: As 2 sneak attack dice, except creatures are staggered on a failed save. <br /><br />6 Sneak Attack Dice: As 2 sneak attack dice, except creatures are nauseated on a failed save.<br /><br />This replaces the ninja trick gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Burst of Blossoms (Su): At 4th level, a petal ninja gains the ability to transform into a cloud of blossoms as a standard action. By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a petal ninja can take the form of a cloud of blossoms, becoming insubstantial for 1 round, as <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=gaseous%20form\">gaseous form</a>. While insubstantial she also gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. At 8th level, the duration increases to a number of rounds equal to 1 plus the petal ninja&rsquo;s Charisma modifier.<br /><br />This replaces no trace, uncanny dodge, and improved uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Sundial (Su): At 6th level, the petal ninja gains the ability to change the lighting in a 30-foot-radius emanation centered on herself as a move action. For every ki point she spends, the light levels change by one step (from darkness to dim light, normal light, and bright light, and vice versa).

Abilities granted by this class other than undercover faith function only while the mask of the Living God is wearing his mask. Putting on or removing this mask is a move action.<br /><br />Undercover Faith (Ex): At 1st level, when not wearing his mask, a mask of the Living God can take on an utterly mundane identity as if he were a vigilante with the many guises social talent. While in a mundane identity, the mask of the Living God cannot wear his mask; putting it on while in a mundane identity immediately ends the mundane identity and its effects. Changing into this mundane identity takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight to preserve the mask of the Living God&rsquo;s secret. The time it takes the mask of the Living God to change into a mundane identity cannot be decreased.<br /><br />This replaces poison use.<br /><br />Expurgate (Sp): The role of a mask of the Living God is to silence heretics and blasphemers, and he is an expert at rendering even the most glib of his foes into babbling fools. At 2nd level, when he deals damage to a target, he can expend 1 point from his ki pool to affect that target as if he had cast fumbletongue, using his ninja level as his caster level. The target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the ninja&rsquo;s level + his Charisma modifier) to negate this effect. At 6th level, the target of this ability is instead struck entirely mute for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will saving throw. The mask of the Living God cannot spend a point from his ki pool to make an additional attack.<br /><br />This alters ki pool.<br /><br />Stern Gaze (Ex): A mask of the Living God is trained to sense deception and strike fear into the hearts of his foes.

At the beginning of any day, the frozen shadow can spend 1 point from his ki pool to benefit from the effects of an endure elements spell. The frozen shadow does not treat any Acrobatics skill check to jump as if he had a running start, and at 10th level he cannot reduce the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by half.<br /><br />This ability alters ki pool.<br /><br />Track Victim (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a frozen shadow adds half his ninja level on Survival checks to follow tracks and on Perception checks to see through disguises.
