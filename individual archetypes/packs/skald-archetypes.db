This raging song functions as song of marching except affected allies also gain the benefits of the Endurance feat in addition to the benefits of any of the following feats the boaster has (even if they don&rsquo;t meet the prerequisites): Deathless Initiate, Deathless Master, Deathless Zealot, Diehard, Fast Healer, Heroic Defiance, and Heroic Recovery.<br /><br />This raging song replaces uncanny dodge and alters song of marching.<br /><br />Song of Surmounting (Su): At 7th level, the boaster&rsquo;s raging song can inspire allies to move quickly and easily. By spending 1 round of raging song, the boaster can affect all allies within 90 feet for 1 hour. Affected allies gain a benefit according to the surrounding terrain (the benefits don&rsquo;t stack): a climb speed equal to half their base speed (forest, jungle, mountain, underground), a swim speed equal to their base speed (swamp, water), or a +10 foot enhancement bonus to their base speed (cold, desert, hill, plains, or urban). The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour; otherwise, its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.

At 19th level, this ability grants triple the listed speed or bonus.<br /><br />This raging song replaces lore master.<br /><br />Frightful Boast (Su): At 14th level, the boaster&rsquo;s raging song can frighten foes, as per the frightening tune bardic performance.<br /><br />This replaces song of the fallen.<br /><br />Rage Power (Ex): The boaster does not gain this ability until 4th level.<br /><br />This alters the skald&rsquo;s rage powers.<br /><br />Greater Endurance: At 6th level, the boaster gains a bonus feat that he qualifies for.

These skalds, known as totem channelers, learn how to share the totems&rsquo; gifts with their allies in the heat of battle.<br /><br />Totemic Versatility (Ex): When a totem channeler learns a new rage power, he can select from more than one group of totem rage powers, even though he normally could not do so. Totem rage powers grant benefits related to a theme, are organized in groups of three, and usually have the word &ldquo;totem&rdquo; in their name. When the totem channeler starts an inspired rage raging song, he can add totem rage powers from only one group at a time. He can change the group of added totem rage powers by ending the current inspired rage and starting a new one.<br /><br />This replaces bardic knowledge and alters rage powers.<br /><br />Tandem Totems (Ex): At 5th level, when a totem channeler starts an inspired rage raging song and adds a totem rage power, he can add totem rage powers from a different group. Adding or maintaining totem rage powers from the additional group requires spending 1 additional round of raging song each round. He can activate up to two additional totem groups at 11th level and up to three additional totem groups at 17th level. He must spend 1 additional round of raging song each round for each additional totem group. If the totem channeler does not have enough rounds of raging song remaining to maintain his inspired rage, the song ends.<br /><br />This replaces spell kenning.<br /><br />Totem&rsquo;s Guidance (Su): At 9th level, the totem channeler can draw strength and protection from his totem powers when he wades into battle with song on his lips. When he adds a totem rage power to his inspired rage, he and his allies gain a +1 insight bonus to AC and on saving throws for the duration of the totem channeler&rsquo;s raging song. At 14th level, this bonus increases to +2.

Most historians find it more likely that a Bekyar skald spent time in Nex, was exposed to the idea of divination as a tool of war from a copy of Cold Irony, and fabricated tales of how that knowledge came to be in his hands.<br /><br />Monster Insight (Ex): At 2nd level, the augur applies his Charisma modifier in addition to his Intelligence modifier when attempting Knowledge checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures. Monster insight counts as the monster lore class feature for prerequisites. This ability replaces well-versed.<br /><br />Signs and Portents (Su): At 2nd level, an augur can read signs and portents to attempt to ascertain how events in the near future will play out. This allows the augur to cast augury as a spell-like ability. At 7th level, he can instead use signs and portents to cast divination as a spell-like ability, and at 12th level, he can instead cast commune as a spell-like ability.

Once per day as a free action, he can declare one of his melee attacks to be a predictive strike. Against the augur&rsquo;s attack, the target is flat-footed and gains no benefits from concealment or cover. Attacks from other creatures are treated normally.

These spirits are able to inflict the misery onto the elegist's enemies.<br /><br />Melancholic Apparition (Su): By using music, oration, and similar performances, an elegist can call forth a physical manifestation of the sorrow of his tales. This functions as a spiritualist's phantom with the despair focus. He can manifest his melancholic apparition as a standard action and dismiss it as a free action. The phantom appears adjacent to the skatd and can act immediately. The melancholic apparition is immediately dismissed if the elegist is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain the performance that keeps the phantom manifested. At 1st level, an elegist can keep his apparition manifested for a total number of rounds each day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each skald level beyond 1st, he can manifest his apparition 2 additional rounds per day.<br /><br />Unlike a spiritualist's phantom, a melancholic apparition can't be harbored in the elegist's consciousness. When manifested, the melancholic apparition has the same number of hit points it had when previously manifested that day. It regains all of its hit points when the elegist regains his spells for the day.

The tengu tendency toward dramatic f lourishes and rhetoric only complicates this debate, creating an environment in which political clubs led by hot-blooded firebrands&mdash;referred to as red tongues in polite company&mdash;dominate the political scene by swaying emotions in the moment and wielding magic in the shadows. Many political debates in Hisuikarasu end in violent brawls or daring duels.<br /><br />Great Orator: A red tongue can activate his raging song performances only by using the Perform (oratory) skill.

Its associated skills are Acrobatics and Fly. This ability alters versatile performance.<br /><br />Fiendish Maw (Su): At 3rd level, whenever a Bekyar demon dancer inspires rage, all who accept his rage gain a bite attack dealing 1d6 points of damage (for Medium allies; 1d4 points of damage if Small).

This ability acts as inspired rage, except those affected gain a +2 morale bonus on melee attack and damage rolls and a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against paralysis and sleep effects (but they still take a &ndash;1 penalty to their AC), rather than inspired rage&rsquo;s normal bonuses.

The wyrm singer selects a single ally within 60 feet to take on a draconic aspect (as per form of the dragon I) of a type of the wyrm singer&rsquo;s choice. The ally cannot use the breath weapon attack provided by form of the dragon. The wyrm singer must expend 1 round of raging song each round to maintain wyrm saga, and can affect only a single ally at a time. <br /><br />This ability replaces song of the fallen. <br /><br />Breath Weapon (Su): At 12th level, once per day as a swift action, a wyrm singer can grant a breath weapon attack to himself or an ally affected by his draconic rage raging song.

With a clash of bracers and a sonorous chant, the Spell Warrior&rsquo;s song reaches out to touch the weapons of his allies, lending them arcane power. While his song does not inspire rage, he can use the power of his music to enchant the weapons of his allies and counter the spells of his foes.<br /><br />Improved Counterspell: At 1st level, the spell warrior receives the Improved Counterspell feat as a bonus feat. This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.<br /><br />Weapon Song (Su): A spell warrior gains the following raging song, allowing him to grant his ally&rsquo;s weapons enhancement bonuses and special powers.<br /><br />Enhance Weapons (Su): At 1st level, the spell warrior can grant a +1 enhancement bonus to the weapons (including ammunition) of allies within 60 feet. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this enhancement bonus increases by 1. The maximum bonus gained is based upon the number of weapons affected: +5 to one weapon, +4 to two weapons, +3 to three weapons, or +2 to four or more weapons. Fifty pieces of ammunition count as one weapon for this purpose. The wielder of a weapon enhanced by this raging song counts as if he were under the effect of an inspired rage raging song for all purposes involving the skald's rage powers.<br /><br />These bonuses can also be used to add any of the following weapon special abilities to the weapons enhanced by this ability: dancing, defending, distance, flaming, frost, ghost touch, keen, mighty cleaving, returning, shock, seeking, or speed. Adding these weapon special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the special ability&rsquo;s cost (see Table 15&ndash;9: Melee Weapon Special Abilities on page 469 of the Core Rulebook). These enhancement bonuses and special abilities overlap with any enhancements or special abilities the weapon already has, though duplicate special abilities do not stack. If an affected weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be.<br /><br />The bonus and special abilities granted by this raging song are determined when the song begins, and cannot be changed until the raging song ends and another is begun. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. This ability replaces the inspired rage raging song.<br /><br />Greater Counterspell (Su): At 5th level, the spell warrior gains increased versatility when attempting to counteract enemy spellcasting. When counterspelling, he can expend two skald spell slots of the same level or higher than the opponent&rsquo;s spell, regardless of the school of that spell.<br /><br />At 11th level, when counterspelling an opponent&rsquo;s spell, the spell warrior only has to expend one skald spell slot of the level of the spell being cast.<br /><br />At 17th level, the spell warrior gains Parry SpellAPG as a bonus feat. The skald does not have to meet the prerequisites for this feat.<br /><br />This ability replaces spell kenning.<br /><br />Song of Arcane Manipulation (Su): At 10th level, a spell warrior can sacrifice his own rage magic to counter an opponent&rsquo;s spell. When using raging song, he can counterspell as an immediate action without interrupting his raging song. However, in addition to expending a spell slot (or spell slots) to attempt to counter the opponent&rsquo;s spell, the skald must expend 1 round of raging song per spell level of the opponent&rsquo;s spell (for example, if attempting to counterspell a 3rd-level spell, the skald must expend one of his own 3rd-level spell slots and 3 rounds of raging song). This ability replaces the dirge of doom raging song.<br /><br />Spell Tamper (Su): At 20th level, when a spell warrior successfully counterspells an opponent&rsquo;s spell, the opponent suffers a backlash of magical energy and takes 1d6 points of damage per spell level of the countered spell. If the opponent succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the skald&rsquo;s level + the skald&rsquo;s Charisma modif ier), the damage is reduced by half. This damage is magical and is not subject to damage reduction or energy resistance.

Rumors tell of waves of snakes slithering forth from their nests in awe as these bellowing commanders take on serpentine features.<br /><br />Serpentine Rage (Su): At 3rd level, a serpent herald can call down Ragadahn&rsquo;s features onto his allies. Allies affected by the serpent herald&rsquo;s inspired rage ability gain a serpentine aspect of the serpent herald&rsquo;s choice (all affected allies gain the same aspect). The serpent herald may choose from the following aspects: movement (+8 competence bonus on Climb and Swim checks, and targets can take 10 on these checks even when rushed or threatened), scales (+2 natural armor bonus), senses (low-light vision and scent), or a natural bite attack (1d4 damage for a Medium creature plus poison [bite&mdash;injury; save Fortitude DC 10 + half the serpent herald&rsquo;s class level + his Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Constitution damage, cure 1 save]). This is a polymorph effect; a creature under another polymorph effect, such as wild shape, does not gain the aspect. If the serpent herald grants one of these aspects to himself, he also gains the ability to speak with animals (reptiles and creatures with the aquatic subtype only) for as long as he has the aspect. The serpent herald must have the inspired rage raging song to use this ability.<br /><br />This ability replaces the rage power gained at 3rd level.<br /><br />Serpent Shape (Su): At 5th level, a serpent herald gains the ability to use wild shape to take the form of a reptile or an aquatic animal once per day, as the druid class feature. His effective druid level for this ability is equal to his serpent herald level &ndash; 1. This doesn&rsquo;t allow him to assume other forms, such as elementals or other kinds of animals. When in animal form, the serpent herald is treated as able to speak normally for the purpose of using raging song, but not for using other abilities that require speech (such as spellcasting).<br /><br />At 11th level, a serpent herald can use this ability twice per day and gains the benefits of the Wild SpeechUM feat while using this ability, treating his druid level as his serpent herald level &ndash; 1.<br /><br />At 17th level, a serpent herald can use this ability three times per day.

Through the power of this mystical ally, the skald can change shapes, assuming its form as his own. Additionally, the totem animal grants the skald a measure of its spiritual power that he can share with his allies.<br /><br />Totem (Su): At 3rd level, the totemic skald chooses one animal from the hunter&rsquo;s animal focus list (see page 27). Once selected, this choice cannot be changed. This animal becomes the skald&rsquo;s personal totem animal and influences his later abilities. He gains the following rage power.<br /><br />Song of the Beast (Su): The totemic skald grants the animal focus abilities of his totem animal (as the hunter&rsquo;s animal focus ability) to all allies affected by his raging song. He treats his skald level as his hunter level for determining the abilities of the animal focus (such as the improvements gained at 8th and 15th level). This ability replaces the rage power gained at 3rd level.<br /><br />Totem Empathy (Ex and Sp): At 4th level, the totemic skald can improve the attitude of animals of the same type as his totem. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The skald rolls 1d20 and adds his skald level and his Charisma modif ier to determine the totem empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.<br /><br />In addition, at 4th level, the totemic skald can cast charm animal once per day as a spell-like ability, using his skald level as his caster level and his Charisma modif ier to determine the DC. This only functions against animals that are of the same type as his totem animal (subject to GM discretion). At 8th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, he can use this ability one additional time per day.<br /><br />This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Wild Shape (Su): At 5th level, a totemic skald gains the ability to wild shape into the form of a Small or Medium version of his totem animal, as the druid class feature. His effective druid level for this ability is equal to his skald level &ndash; 1. He can use this ability twice per day at 11th level, and three times per day at 17th level. This doesn&rsquo;t allow the skald to assume other forms, such as elementals, plants, or other kinds of animals.<br /><br />When in animal form, the skald is treated as able to speak normally for the purpose of using raging song, but not for using other abilities that require speech (such as spellcasting).

Among cultures where skalds are the keepers of lore and wisdom, there are those who learn to read the winds of fate and take up the mantle of the fated champion, knowing and embracing their destined paths with strength borne of conviction.<br /><br />Watcher of the Weave (Ex): At 2nd level, a fated champion learns to see the tapestry of events moments before it is woven. He gains an insight bonus on initiative checks equal to 1/2 his skald level. This ability replaces well-versed.<br /><br />Far Seer (Su): At 5th level, a fated champion learns a method of spell kenning that is especially suited for divining and understanding the future, but not for directly harming opponents. For the purpose of determining what level spell slot he expends when using spell kenning, the skald treats the spell level of spells that predict the future (such as augury and divination) as one spell level lower (minimum spell level 1st), and treats the spell level of spells that deal damage as one spell level higher. This alters the spell kenning class feature.<br /><br />Shield of Foresight (Su): At 10th level, a fated champion&rsquo;s certainty of his own fate grants him the ability to stare down fear and remain unbowed. When using raging song, he is immune to fear effects, and allies affected by his raging song gain a +5 bonus on saves attempted against fear effects. This ability replaces the dirge of doom raging song.<br /><br />Not This Day (Su): At 20th level, the fated champion gains the ability to reweave the strands of fate. As an immediate action, he can expend 10 rounds of raging song to either reroll a saving throw or force an opponent to reroll an attack roll. The decision to use this ability must be made before the results of the initial roll are revealed, and the champion or his opponent must take the result of the reroll. This ability replaces master skald.<br /><br />Rage Powers: The following rage powers complement the fated champion archetype: boasting tauntAPG, clear mind, eater of magicUC, fierce fortitude*, flesh woundAPG, guarded lifeAPG, intimidating glare, linnorm death curse* (cairn, tarn), and renewed vitalityUC.

To these skalds, the passionate frenzy of a celebration or feast shares many features with the violence of combat, and several of their talents blur the line between festival and battle in dramatic ways.<br /><br />Fermented Fruit (Sp): A bacchanal adds goodberry to his list of 1st-level skald spells known. In addition, he can cast it as a spell-like ability once per day. When he casts goodberry as a spell or spell-like ability, the targeted berries ferment; this causes each berry to act as a serving of an alcoholic beverage. A creature that eats a fermented berry does not gain a meal&rsquo;s nourishment, but it is cured of 1 point of damage and becomes slightly foolhardy as if tipsy, gaining a +1 bonus on saves against fear effects for 1 minute after eating the berry.<br /><br />This replaces Scribe Scroll.<br /><br />Drunken Dancer (Su): At 2nd level, while maintaining a raging song, a bacchanal can consume a berry affected by goodberry, a potion, or a serving of alcohol as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A berry affected by goodberry or a potion has its normal effect, while an alcoholic drink or a berry affected by goodberry via fermented fruit (see above) allows the skald to maintain his raging song that round without expending a round of raging song for the day (instead of the normal effects of the alcohol or fermented berry). For each alcoholic drink or fermented berry consumed while raging, the skald is nauseated for 1 round after his raging song ends. The internal fortitude rage power prevents this nauseated condition from occurring.<br /><br />At 7th level, when the bacchanal consumes an alcoholic drink or fermented berry while maintaining his rage song, he can gain the benefits of cure light wounds or remove fear (for the duration of the raging song) at his caster level by spending 2 rounds of raging song. At 12th level, the bacchanal can gain the benefits of heroism (for the duration of the raging song) in this manner. At 17th level, he can gain the benefits of persistent vigor (for the duration of the raging song) in this manner.<br /><br />This replaces versatile performance.<br /><br />Raging Song (Su): A bacchanal gains access to the following raging songs.<br /><br />Song of Urging (Su) At 3rd level, the bacchanal&rsquo;s raging song can wordlessly influence creatures of the wild. This raging song functions just like a Diplomacy check to make a simple request or an Intimidate check but can influence only animals. The bacchanal rolls 1d20 and adds his skald level and his Charisma modifier to determine the urging check&rsquo;s result. Bonuses and penalties that apply to wild empathy checks apply to these urging checks. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. The song can influence plants or magical beasts with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 as well as drunken creatures of any Intelligence (even without sharing a language), but against these nonanimals, the bacchanal takes a &ndash;4 penalty on this check. The bacchanal must continue to perform the song for the entire time required for the check; otherwise, its effect is wasted, but only 1 round of raging song is expended regardless of how long the check takes.<br /><br />This raging song replaces song of marching.<br /><br />Maddening Dance (Su): At 10th level, the bacchanal&rsquo;s raging song can compel a creature within 30 feet to perform an ecstatic dance. Unless it succeeds at its Will save, the victim becomes confused, takes a &ndash;2 penalty to its AC and on Reflex saving throws, and loses the benefit of any shield it holds. The effect ends when the target can no longer hear the bacchanal from within 30 feet. As an immediate action, an ally of the bacchanal within 30 feet can dance along as a full-round action (taking all penalties except the confused condition for that round) to allow the bacchanal to target an additional creature. A creature that succeeds at the Will saving throw against this raging song is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a compulsion, emotion, enchantment, and mind-affecting effect.<br /><br />This raging song replaces dirge of doom.<br /><br />Rage Powers: The following rage powers complement the bacchanal archetype: animal fury, boasting taunt, fearless rage, fierce fortitude, increased damage reduction, internal fortitude, liquid courage, night vision, roaring drunk, and staggering drunk.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Skald","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/drum.jpg","_id":"mE48ulBuzXSFAsO8"}

This ability modifies the skald&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Raging Song (Su): An urban skald gains a different selection of raging songs, as noted below. The save DC for a raging song that allows a save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the urban skald&rsquo;s skald level + his Charisma modifier.<br /><br />Controlled Inspired Rage (Su): When the urban skald inspires rage, he does not grant the normal benefits. Instead, he can apply a +2 morale bonus to his allies&rsquo; Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and to +6 at 16th level. The urban skald can apply the full bonus to one ability score or split the bonus between several scores in increments of 2. The choice applies to all affected allies. The controlled inspired rage grants no bonus on Will saves, imposes no penalties to AC, and does not prevent affected allies from using Intelligence-, Dexterity-, or Charisma-based skills. This alters inspired rage.<br /><br />Infuriating Mockery (Su): At 3rd level, the urban skald can inspire reckless fury in one foe within 30 feet. If the foe fails a Will saving throw, it takes a &ndash;2 penalty to AC and on attack rolls, cannot use any Intelligence-, Dexterity-, or Charismabased skills, and must succeed at a concentration check to cast spells (DC = 15 + spell level) for as long as it remains in range of the skald and the performance is maintained. At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the urban skald can target an additional foe with this ability. This replaces song of marching and damage reduction.<br /><br />Humiliating Defamation (Su): At 10th level, the urban skald can ostracize a foe. The song has one primary target, who the skald must see and name or describe. That target must attempt a Will save. On a failed save, the primary target cannot benefit from any morale bonus or teamwork feats, cannot treat any creature as an ally, and must attempt to save against any spell cast on it (including harmless spells, even if it casts them on itself ). These effects remain as long as the primary target can hear the skald and the skald maintains the performance.<br /><br />All other foes within 60 feet of the skald are secondary targets. Secondary targets must succeed at Will saves or they cannot treat the primary target as an ally, and cannot target it with spells or abilities that are harmless. These effects remain as long as the secondary targets are within 60 feet of the skald and the skald maintains the performance. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect.<br /><br />This ability replaces dirge of doom.<br /><br />Back of the Crowd (Ex): At 3rd level, an urban skald has learned to maximize the defensive benefit of being near allies. He gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC when adjacent to 2 or more allies. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and to +3 at 15th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Skald","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/drum.jpg","_id":"nuHpdIVBP752h6kP"}

Deeply devoted to the elven goddess Findeladlara, twilight speakers wander far and wide, vigilant for threats to their homes and their people.<br /><br />Twilight speaker is a skald archetype that is available only to elves.<br /><br />Devout: A twilight speaker must worship the elven goddess Findeladlara, and his alignment must be within one step of chaotic good. A twilight speaker who does not meet these requirements cannot use inspired devotion or Findeladlara&rsquo;s blessing.<br /><br />Twilight Envoy: A twilight speaker gains a bonus equal to half his skald level on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks.<br /><br />This replaces bardic knowledge.<br /><br />Raging Song (Su): A twilight speaker gains the following raging songs.<br /><br />Inspired Devotion (Su): The twilight speaker inspires fervor rather than fury. Affected allies gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws. At 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, these bonuses increase by 1.<br /><br />Song of Understanding (Su): At 6th level, a twilight speaker can use his raging song to create an aura that allows creatures to speak and understand each others&rsquo; languages. By expending 4 rounds of raging song, the twilight speaker creates an aura that grants him and creatures in a 60-foot spread centered on him the effects of tongues. This aura uses the skald&rsquo;s level as the caster level for all purposes, including duration. A twilight speaker can dismiss this aura as a standard action.<br /><br />Song of Secrecy (Su): At 10th level, a twilight speaker can use his song to shroud allies from detection.

Some court poets go on to create their own works, weaving their magic and force of personality into their unique performances.<br /><br />Raging Song (Su): A court poet gains the following raging songs, allowing her to use oratory, music, and other performances to elevate the aesthetic sensibilities of her allies. Insightful Contemplation (Su): At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Intelligence and Charisma and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but they also take a &ndash;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of insightful contemplation, allies other than the court poet can&rsquo;t use any Strength-based skills or make any physical effort that requires a Constitution check.

Once per day, when he fails a saving throw against a compulsion effect, he can attempt another saving throw after 1 time increment (1 round if the effect is measured in rounds, 1 minute if the effect is measured in minutes, 10 minutes if the spell is measured in 10-minute increments, and so on). Every 6 skald levels thereafter, he gains an additional daily use of this ability (to a maximum of 3 per day at 19th level).<br /><br />This ability replaces lore master.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Skald","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/drum.jpg","_id":"tzMcdXQg4H82YAUM"}

She is a warrior-poet, as skilled with her words as she is with blades. Battle scions sometimes rule as queens over courts of brave knights who scour the world championing bold quests.<br /><br />Courtly Presence (Ex): At 1st level, a battle scion&rsquo;s bearing radiates command and presence, allowing her to tower over her opponents in social situations. The battle scion adds 1/2 her character level to Intimidate checks, and she starts any verbal duel with an extra edge that she can use for the presence tactic so long as she is not at a significant or extreme disadvantage in the duel. However, her bardic knowledge ability applies to only Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), and Knowledge (nobility).<br /><br />This ability alters bardic knowledge.<br /><br />Battle Prowess (Ex): Whenever a battle scion would gain a rage power from the skald&rsquo;s rage power ability (at 3rd level and every 3 skald levels thereafter), she can instead choose to gain a combat feat or teamwork feat for which she meets the prerequisites. Like rage powers she selects in this way, the battle scion can grant this feat to allies under the effect of inspired rage, as long as those allies also meet the prerequisites, but she must expend 2 rounds of raging song for each round in which she grants a combat feat or teamwork feat. If the battle scion gains multiple feats from battle prowess, allies can use these feats to meet the prerequisites for other feats while they&rsquo;re affected by battle prowess (for example, a battle scion with Power Attack and Cleave from battle prowess could grant both, allowing allies with a +1 base attack bonus and a Strength score of 13 to gain both, since they can use Power Attack to qualify for Cleave).<br /><br />This alters the rage power ability.<br /><br />Raging Song (Su): A battle scion gains the following raging song. Song of Questing (Su): At 10th level, the battle scion can spend 4 rounds of raging song to draw upon a target&rsquo;s honor, ambition, and sense of self in order to bind the target to an agreed-upon task, often a noble quest. This works like geas/quest, except it applies only if the target is truly willing (not magically compelled or tricked), and the target automatically understands the full terms of the agreement before deciding whether he is willing.<br /><br />The battle scion can offer a reward for the completion of the noble quest, but if she does so and fails to live up to her agreement, she becomes an ex-battle scion and loses all benefits gained from the archetype (she does not gain the abilities they replaced, either). At 14th level, she can offer the same quest to up to one willing creature per skald level. If she does so, the effect ends for all creatures as soon as anyone completes the quest, though only the creature who completes it earns any offered reward.<br /><br />This ability replaces dirge of doom and song of the fallen.<br /><br />Once and Future Scion (Su): At 20th level, a battle scion becomes extremely difficult to kill. Whenever she is slain, as long as her body isn&rsquo;t destroyed, she enters a deathlike sleep for 3 days, after which she returns to life as per raise dead, except that it can restore her even if she was slain by a death effect. Spells that would restore her to life function as if she were dead during this time, allowing her to recover sooner.<br /><br />This ability replaces master skald.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Skald","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/drum.jpg","_id":"vHogqSCDtmJZbBKX"}

Whether with the polished metal trumpet of a standing army or the crude curved animal horn of savage raiders, a herald of the horn sounds his raging song with thunderous blasts, which can bolster allies or shatter castle walls.<br /><br />Arcane Bond (Ex): At 1st level, a herald of the horn forms a powerful bond with a horn (musical instrument). This functions like an arcane bloodline sorcerer&rsquo;s arcane bond with an object. Like a weapon, wand, or staff, the horn must be held in one hand when the herald of the horn casts skald spells. This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.<br /><br />Rousing Retort (Su): At 5th level, a herald of the horn can use raging song to free allies from enchantment effects and fear. When beginning a raging song, he can expend 4 rounds of that ability to grant all allies within 60 feet a new saving throw against an ongoing enchantment or fear effect. The allies gain a +2 bonus on this new saving throw. This ability replaces the first daily use of spell kenning gained at 5th level.<br /><br />Horn Call (Su): At 7th level, a herald&rsquo;s horn enhances his sonic spells. If a skald spell with the sonic descriptor is cast using the horn, its DC increases by 1. These DCs increase by an additional 1 at 13th and 19th levels. This ability replaces lore master.<br /><br />Crumbling Blast (Su): At 11th level, a herald of the horn can use his horn to create a devastating shock wave of energy. Once per day, he can sound a note on the horn that functions like a horn of blasting (DC = 10 + 1/2 the herald of the horn&rsquo;s level + his Charisma bonus). At 17th level, the herald of the horn can use this ability twice per day and it functions like a greater horn of blasting. Unlike an actual horn of blasting, this ability does not carry the risk of destroying the horn. This ability replaces the second and third daily uses of spell kenning gained at 11th and 17th levels.<br /><br />Rage Powers: The following rage powers complement the herald of the horn archetype: battle roar*, energy absorptionAPG, energy eruptionAPG, fearless rage, knockback, knockdownAPG, smasherAPG, and swift foot.

The warlord doesn&rsquo;t inspire his followers so much as instill fear in them. Always watching his foes for moments of vulnerability, the warlord seeks to exploit his enemies&rsquo; weaknesses to gain victory. <br /><br />Intimidating Prowess: A warlord gains Intimidating Prowess as a bonus feat. <br /><br />This feat replaces the Scribe Scroll feat.<br /><br />Unshakable (Ex): At 2nd level, a warlord develops an unshakable resolve, gaining a +2 bonus on saving throws against fear effects.<br /><br />This ability replaces well-versed.<br /><br />Raging Song (Su): A warlord gains the following raging song.<br /><br />Fear Me (Su): At 5th level, the warlord can remind his allies that failing him is far more frightening than the opposition. This raging song works like distraction, except that it applies to saving throws against fear effects instead of patterns and figments, and the warlord attempts an Intimidate check with a &ndash;10 penalty instead of a Perform check. Additionally, the warlord&rsquo;s allies can use the warlord&rsquo;s Intimidate check result (with the &ndash;10 penalty) as the DC for attempts to demoralize them using Intimidate.<br /><br />This ability replaces spell kenning.<br /><br />Minions (Ex): At 7th level, a warlord attracts a group of followers through his fearsome reputation and gains the Leadership feat as a bonus feat.<br /><br />This replaces the lore master ability.<br /><br />Intimidated Push (Ex): At 8th level, a warlord inspires fear in his cohort and followers, ensuring they do not fail and thus suffer his wrath.

The war painter must expend 1 or more rounds of his raging song class ability while anointing the ally, and the paint retains its potency until the war painter recovers his daily uses of raging song. The ally can activate the paint as a move action, gaining the benefits of the raging song, including any rage powers as appropriate. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the rounds of raging song the war painter expended + the war painter&rsquo;s ranks in Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos)&mdash;but no more than double the number of rounds of raging song expended. By halving the remaining number of rounds of raging song, an ally can suspend the paint&rsquo;s effects as a free action and activate the paint again later as a move action.<br /><br />A war painter cab apply the effects of any feats that affect bardic performance to his furious paint, except effects that extend the effects of performances, such as the <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Lingering%20Song\">Lingering Song</a> feat. A creature can be subject to only one application of furious paint at a time.<br /><br />This ability modifies the raging song class feature and does not prevent a war painter from performing other raging songs.<br /><br />Thousand Totems (Su): At 5th level, a war painter can channel a powerful totem into his furious paints while applying the pigments on an ally. This grants the painted ally the benefits of one additional rage power when the ally activates the furious paints. The war painter does not need to know the rage power, but it must be one for which he qualifies. Furthermore, the war painter can select only a blood rage power (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 80) or a totem rage power (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide 74). If the war painter already has a different blood rage or totem rage power that would be applied to the painted ally, this new rage power replaces it and any other rage powers that require it as a prerequisite.<br /><br />A war painter can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and he gains one additional use at 11th and 17th levels. He can apply this ability multiple times to the same creature, though only to give it rage powers that use the granted rage power as a prerequisite (such as beast totem and greater beast totem).<br /><br />This ability replaces spell kenning. <br /><br />Arcane Flourish (Su): At 7th level, once per day as he finishes applying his furious paint to a creature, a war painter can cast one skald spell with a casting time of no more than 1 standard action and infuse the spell into the paint. Once while benefiting from the paint&rsquo;s raging song, the painted ally can use a standard action to cast the infused spell on herself as if the war painter had cast it. The spell ends when the paint&rsquo;s other effects end. A war painter can infuse only a skald spell whose level is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level skald spell he can cast. He can infuse any targeted spell in a painted ally, even if its range is personal. The war painter can use this ability twice per day at 13th level and three times per day at 19th level.<br /><br />This ability replaces lore master.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Skald","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/drum.jpg","_id":"wZC5yWe9HiI0a2HB"}
