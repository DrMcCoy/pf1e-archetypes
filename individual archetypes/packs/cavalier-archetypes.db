This effect doesn&rsquo;t stack with any other effect that expands the critical threat range of a weapon. Whenever he performs a charge, the charger can make an additional hoof attack against his target with a &ndash;5 penalty on his attack roll. This ability replaces cavalier&rsquo;s charge.<br /><br />Courser (Ex): At 4th level, a charger&rsquo;s constant training increases his land speed by 10 feet.

Apply this bonus before modifying the charger&rsquo;s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. These bonuses stack with any other bonuses to the charger&rsquo;s land speed or ability to ignore difficult terrain.

Though not as celebrated as the cavaliers who ride forth to take on distant foes, the castellan is no less brave or important, for the castellan and his allies are the last line of defense for those who depend on the fortification for protection.<br /><br />Castle Defender: At 1st level, a castellan gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class and an additional +1 bonus on attack rolls when he is on higher ground. He also gains an additional +1 bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves when he has cover other than soft cover from other creatures. At 6th level, a castellan gains evasion (as a rogue) when he has cover (but not soft cover) against the source of the attack. At 11th level, these bonuses increase by 1. At 16th level, he gains improved evasion instead of evasion. Both the evasion and improved evasion abilities work even when the castellan wears medium or heavy armor. This ability replaces mount.<br /><br />Castle Lore: At 3rd level, the castellan gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (engineering), Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), Perception, and Stealth checks when he is in urban terrain, including fortifications. A castellan in an urban environment can always act in a surprise round, though he remains flat-footed until he acts. At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the castellan&rsquo;s bonuses on skill and initiative checks increase by 2. This ability replaces cavalier&rsquo;s charge.<br /><br />Guard Companion: At 4th level, the castellan forms a bond with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Companion\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;that serves as a guard. While most castellans select birds or canines, the castellan can choose any animal companions available to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ranger\">rangers</a>. This ability functions like the druid nature bond ability, except that the castellan&rsquo;s effective druid level is equal to his cavalier level &ndash; 3 and his animal companion doesn&rsquo;t gain the share spells special ability. This ability replaces expert trainer.<br /><br />Mighty Defense: At 11th level, when the castellan readies an action to make a melee attack against a creature that is not yet adjacent to him, he doubles the threat range of any melee weapons wielded during the attack. This increase doesn&rsquo;t stack with other effects that increase the threat range of his weapons. In addition, the cavalier can attempt a free dirty trick, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his readied attack is successful. This free combat maneuver doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces mighty charge.<br /><br />Defending Challenge: At 12th level, the castellan takes no penalty to Armor Class when using his challenge ability. This ability replaces demanding challenge.<br /><br />Supreme Defense: At 20th level, whenever the castellan readies an action to make a melee attack against a creature that is not yet adjacent to him, his readied attack deals double the normal amount of damage (or triple the damage if using a brace weapon against a charge). In addition, if the cavalier confirms a critical hit on the readied attack, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + the cavalier&rsquo;s class level + the cavalier&rsquo;s Strength modifier) reduces this to being staggered for 1d4 rounds.

He can attempt Knowledge checks untrained to identify monsters and their weaknesses, and gains a bonus equal to half of his cavalier level on Knowledge checks to identify monsters.<br /><br />This ability replaces expert trainer.<br /><br />Weapon Training (Ex): At 5th level, a disciple of the pike gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Fighter\">weapon training, just like a fighter</a>. He must select polearms or spears as his weapon group, and never gains another weapon group. His bonuses with the selected group otherwise progress as though his fighter level were equal to his cavalier level.<br /><br />This ability replaces banner and greater banner.<br /><br />Agile Charger (Ex): At 11th level, a disciple of the pike takes no penalties caused by difficult terrain while charging. His movement is still hampered by obstacles, poor visibility, and other conditions. This ability doesn&rsquo;t allow him to move through impassible terrain.<br /><br />This ability replaces mighty charge.<br /><br />Deadly Charge (Ex): At 20th level, whenever a disciple of the pike makes a charge attack with a polearm or spear, he deals double the normal amount of damage. In addition, if he confirms a critical hit on a deadly charge, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. If the target succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + the cavalier&rsquo;s base attack bonus), it is instead staggered for 1d4 rounds.<br /><br />This ability replaces supreme charge.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Cavalier","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horseshoe.jpg"}

Musketeers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with firearms.

The musketeer can use this ability twice per day, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 8th, to a total of five times per day at 20th level.<br /><br />At 8th level, the cavalier gains the benefit of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Improved%20Critical\">Improved Critical</a>&nbsp;feat. At 11th level, he can reduce the misfire chance of his weapon by 1 (to a minimum of 1), and at 17th level, the musketeer can double the range increment of his weapon. The reduction of the weapon&rsquo;s misfire chance and the doubled range increment abilities don&rsquo;t stack with the similar benefits of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Reliable\">reliable</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Distance\">distance</a>&nbsp;magic weapon special abilities.<br /><br />Finally, at 20th level, during a period of such focus, the musketeer can engage in a flurry of gunfire. The cavalier can expend one of his daily challenges to make a full attack with his firearm. The musketeer ignores the normal load times for his weapon, but must still expend enough doses of powder and enough bullets to complete each attack.<br /><br />If the musketeer&rsquo;s gifted firearm is destroyed, the cavalier loses this ability for 30 days while a replacement weapon is crafted for him. During this 30-day period, the musketeer takes a &ndash;1 penalty on weapon and damage rolls. This ability replaces the standard cavalier&rsquo;s mount ability.<br /><br />Swift Powder (Ex): At 4th level, the musketeer gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Rapid%20Reload\">Rapid Reload (musket)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Rapid%20Reload\">Rapid Reload (pistol)</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat.

Whether or not these paragons descend from a single nagaji, first mother&rsquo;s fangs of Nagajor have expanded their numbers over the generations, and they no longer speak with the full authority of the First Mother. In modern times, a first mother&rsquo;s fang acts as a servant of his nation, a skilled general and tactician in times of war and a noble governor during times of peace.<br /><br />Class Skills: A first mother&rsquo;s fang adds all Knowledge skills to his list of class skills.<br /><br />This alters the cavalier&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A first mother&rsquo;s fang is proficient with all simple and martial weapons.

Those cavaliers most gifted at command often become daring generals.<br /><br />Aides-de-Camp (Ex): A daring general gains a modified version of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Leadership\">Leadership</a>&nbsp;feat at 6th level, even if he doesn&rsquo;t meet the prerequisites. All followers that the daring general gains as a result of this version of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Leadership\">Leadership</a>&nbsp;feat can only have levels in the warrior class. All cohorts that the daring general gains from this ability must have levels only in classes that grant a full base attack bonus (such as barbarian, fighter, paladin, or ranger), and must be at least 4 levels lower than the daring general himself. However, at 12th level and 18th level, the daring general gains an additional cohort (up to a maximum of three cohorts at 18th level) and a number of additional followers equal to the number of followers he gained from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Leadership\">Leadership</a>&nbsp;feat (up to a maximum of triple his normal number of followers at 18th level). When determining the kinds of cohorts the daring general can attract, he treats his Leadership score as 3 lower for each subsequent cohort (effectively taking a &ndash;3 penalty for the second cohort and a &ndash;6 penalty for the third cohort).<br /><br />Additionally, the daring general can grant special roles to his cohorts, as outlined below. Unless otherwise stated, only one cohort can fill any given role at any given time. Designating a cohort as filling a special role requires a 24-hour ceremonial ritual.<br /><br />Groom: The groom cares for the daring general&rsquo;s mount. She does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding the cavalier&rsquo;s mount. Additionally, once per day, the groom can spend 10 minutes preparing the daring general&rsquo;s mount for battle. If she does, the mount&rsquo;s speed increases by 10 feet and its Dexterity score increases by 2. These benefits last for 1 hour.<br /><br />Squire: The squire&rsquo;s main task is to care for the daring general&rsquo;s arms and armor. If the squire aids the daring general in donning his armor, it takes half as much time to don as it would if someone else aided the daring general. Additionally, when the squire is adjacent to the daring general, as a standard action, she can grant a +2 bonus to the daring general&rsquo;s AC against the first attack made against the daring general before the squire&rsquo;s next turn. This counts as an application of the aid another action, but the squire does not need to threaten the attacker in question.<br /><br />Standard Bearer: The daring general&rsquo;s standard bearer can carry his banner in his stead, granting the benefits of his banner ability (and later, his greater banner ability) to all allies within 60 feet of the standard bearer. If the standard bearer becomes unconscious or dead, she ceases to grant these benefits.<br /><br />Beyond the rules noted above, if the daring general uses his followers to create an army using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Mass%20Combat&amp;Category=Kingdoms%20and%20War\">mass combat</a>&nbsp;rules, that army starts with one extra&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Army%20Tactics&amp;Category=Mass%20Combat\">tactic</a>&nbsp;of the daring general&rsquo;s choice and a +2 bonus to its morale score.<br /><br />The daring general can assign each of his followers individually to serve as either footmen or honor guards (described below). He does not need to assign either role to a given follower, if he prefers. He can change the role of a follower at any time, but it takes 1 day per level for the follower to change her tactics to suit her new role. Followers with a particular role must group together with other followers with the same role to form an army in mass combat.<br /><br />Footman: Each follower gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls, but takes a &ndash;2 penalty to her AC and on saving throws. A footman unit gains a +2 bonus to its OM and takes a &ndash;2 penalty to its DV in mass combat.<br /><br />Honor Guard: The follower gains a +2 bonus to her AC and on saving throws, but takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. An honor guard unit gains a +2 bonus to its DV and takes a &ndash;2 penalty to its OM in mass combat.<br /><br />This ability replaces the bonus feats gained at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.<br /><br />Shared Challenge (Ex): At 12th level, when a daring general issues a challenge, his followers and cohorts take up that challenge alongside him. Whenever the daring general uses his challenge class feature, as long as the challenge remains in effect, each of the daring general&rsquo;s followers and cohorts that are within 30 feet of him gain a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls made against the target of his challenge.<br /><br />This ability replaces demanding challenge.<br /><br />Supreme Tactician (Ex): At 20th level, whenever the daring general uses his tactician ability, he can grant any number of teamwork feats that he knows to his allies, and when he uses his tactician ability as a standard action in combat, it does not count against his daily uses of tactician. This ability replaces supreme charge.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Cavalier","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horseshoe.jpg"}

Even after being accepted back into Korvosan society or fleeing the reach of the city&rsquo;s justice, the Gray Maidens&rsquo; sisterhood has endured.<br /><br />Sisters-in-arms are almost never neutral on the subject of Queen Ileosa; some still hold true to the cruel queen&rsquo;s ideals and lead bands of like-minded veterans, while others have forsaken Ileosa in favor of total devotion to their fellow survivors. Of the latter, the majority support the Scarlet Rose, whether as social and emotional support for their recovering sisters, as field commanders for military endeavors, or as private adventurers with ties to the order. Loyalist sisters-in-arms, by contrast, are almost always plotting to reclaim Korvosa.<br /><br />Halfhearted Challenge (Ex): Sisters-in-arms vigilantly protect their allies, weakening their focus on their challenged foe. A sister-in-arms adds only half her cavalier level (minimum 1) to damage rolls against her challenge target.<br /><br />This ability alters challenge.<br /><br />Maiden&rsquo;s Order (Ex): All sisters-in-arms share a talent for aiding and inspiring their fellow Gray Maidens, strengthened by training and the bond of sisterhood. Generally, those loyal to Queen Ileosa refer to their pledge as the order of the fanged crown, while those who have forsaken the cruel queen call it the order of the scarlet rose. In either case, the benefits are the same.<br /><br />A sister-in-arms does not choose an order. Instead, she is considered to belong to both the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/CavalierOrders.aspx?ItemName=Order%20of%20the%20Dragon\">order of the dragon</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/CavalierOrders.aspx?ItemName=Order%20of%20the%20Lion\">order of the lion</a>, and she gains all of the benefits of both orders (including additional class skills and conditional skill bonuses, additional challenge benefits, and order abilities) at the appropriate levels. At 1st level, a sister-in-arms chooses which order&rsquo;s edicts she must follow; generally, those of the fanged crown choose the order of the lion&rsquo;s edicts, while those of the scarlet rose choose the order of the dragon&rsquo;s edicts.<br /><br />This ability alters order and replaces mount.<br /><br />Devoted Defender (Ex): Sisters-in-arms cling to their fellow Gray Maidens as closely as family and protect them with intense devotion. At 3rd level, a sister-in-arms gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Bodyguard\">Bodyguard</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat (she does not need to meet the feat&rsquo;s prerequisite).<br /><br />This ability replaces cavalier&rsquo;s charge.<br /><br />Maiden&rsquo;s Loyalty (Ex): The loyalty of a sister-in-arms is absolute. At 4th level, a sister-in-arms gains a +2 bonus on Will saves against any effect that would compel her to attack or betray her allies. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 4th.<br /><br />This ability replaces expert trainer.<br /><br />Dedicated Commander (Ex): A sister-in-arms can inspire and direct allies with great efficiency. At 11th level, the sister-in-arms can use&nbsp;&lt;cav.orders%order of=\"\" the=\"\" lion\"=\"\"&gt;lion&rsquo;s call or&nbsp;&lt;cav.orders%order of=\"\" the=\"\" dragon\"=\"\"&gt;strategy order as a move action, rather than as a standard action.

This replaces the cavalier&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Champion&rsquo;s Finesse (Ex): At 1st level, a daring champion gains the benefits of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Weapon%20Finesse\">Weapon Finesse</a>&nbsp;feat with light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, and he can use Charisma in place of Intelligence for the purpose of combat feats prerequisites.

Their strange abilities mark them as outsiders and stoic loners, and they stay in one place only long enough to help the afflicted before riding off to unknown destinations.<br /><br />Ghost Mount (Su): At 1st level, a ghost rider gains the ability to manifest a special mount of conjured ectoplasm rather than one of flesh and bone. This spectral companion functions like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Phantom\">spiritualist&rsquo;s phantom companion</a>, using the ghost rider&rsquo;s cavalier level as her effective spiritualist level. The phantom takes the form of a ghostly creature analogous to one of a cavalier&rsquo;s normal mount options for her size and class level, such as a Large horse for a Medium ghost rider or a wolf for a Small ghost rider. A ghost rider must choose a mount that is capable of bearing her weight, that has four or more legs, and that lacks a fly speed (although the GM may allow mounts with a swim speed in certain environments). The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts.<br /><br />The ghost rider can manifest her ghost mount only in ectoplasmic form, and she gains the spiritualist&rsquo;s etheric tether class feature, applied to her ghost mount. The mount shares the cavalier&rsquo;s alignment. Though the mount cannot speak, it understands its master&rsquo;s verbal commands and gains the phantom&rsquo;s link ability. The ghost mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves, and can have ranks in any of the following skills: Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Escape Artist (Dex), Fly (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str). The ghost rider&rsquo;s ghost mount does not gain the share spells, deliver touch spells, or incorporeal flight abilities. Ghost mounts do not gain emotional focus abilities.<br /><br />The ghost rider does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding her mount. The mount is always considered combat trained, and begins play with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Endurance\">Endurance</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat.<br /><br />Ghost Mount Starting Statistics:&nbsp;Type&nbsp;animal (phantom);&nbsp;Size&nbsp;one size category larger than the ghost rider;&nbsp;Speed&nbsp;50 ft.;&nbsp;AC&nbsp;+4 natural armor;&nbsp;Attack&nbsp;bite (1d4), 2 hooves (1d6; this is a secondary natural attack);&nbsp;Ability Scores&nbsp;Str 16, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6.<br /><br />This ability replaces mount.<br /><br />Frightful Gaze (Su): At 1st level, a ghost rider can use this ability on opponents within 30 feet as a standard action, which acts as a gaze attack until the ghost rider&rsquo;s next turn. Creatures within range that meet the ghost rider&rsquo;s gaze must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ghost rider&rsquo;s class level + the ghost rider&rsquo;s Charisma modifier) or stand paralyzed in fear for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Creatures that successfully save against that ghost rider&rsquo;s frightful gaze are immune to it for 24 hours. At 9th level, this ability can affect creatures that are mindless or immune to mind-affecting effects, though it still counts as a fear effect. The ghost rider can use this ability a number of times each day equal to her Charisma modifier.<br /><br />This ability replaces tactician, greater tactician, and master tactician.<br /><br />Fearless (Su): At 3rd level, a ghost rider becomes immune to fear. Each ally within 10 feet of the ghost rider gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while the ghost rider is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead. This ability replaces cavalier&rsquo;s charge.<br /><br />Spirited Mount (Su): At 5th level, the ghost rider&rsquo;s mount ignores difficult terrain. At 8th level, it gains the ability to use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=water%20walk\">water walk</a>&nbsp;at will. This ability replaces expert trainer and banner.<br /><br />Ghost Wind (Su): At 11th level, the ghost rider&rsquo;s ghost mount can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=air%20walk\">air walk</a>&nbsp;(as the spell, no action required) at will for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground. At 14th level, the mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to the ghost rider&rsquo;s class level.

This NPC functions similarly to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Leadership\">cohort</a>, though the aide-de-camp must advance in a class that grants proficiency with all martial weapons and cannot multiclass until the esquire reaches 7th level (though the aide-de-camp can select an archetype). If the aide-de-camp is a cavalier, he must follow the same order as the esquire.<br /><br />The aide-de-camp gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Swift%20Aid\">Swift Aid</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat, and provides a +2 (rather than +1) bonus when using this feat to aid the esquire. As a move action, the aide-de-camp can retrieve a stored item or an item on the ground and hand it to the esquire. The esquire does not have to take an action to receive the item, though he must be conscious and have a free hand. This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity for the aide-de-camp or esquire.<br /><br />If the aide-de-camp dies performing an act that directly supports the edicts of the esquire&rsquo;s order (GM&rsquo;s discretion), the esquire does not take a penalty to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Leadership\">Leadership</a>&nbsp;score. If an aide-de-camp dies, or is released from the esquire&rsquo;s service, the esquire may gain a new aide-de-camp by scouting for potential candidates in a city or large town. This requires 1 day per 5 levels of the aide-de-camp to be recruited. This ability replaces mount.<br /><br />Teamwork (Ex): At 3rd level, as long as an esquire and his aide-de-camp are adjacent, the aide-de-camp is treated as having any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?Category=Teamwork\">teamwork feats</a>&nbsp;the esquire has. They also share any teamwork feats that function when two or more allies threaten the same target, as long as they both threaten the same target. This ability replaces cavalier&rsquo;s charge.<br /><br />Shared Challenge (Ex): At 4th level, whenever an esquire challenges an opponent when his aide-de-camp is within 30 feet, he may grant his aide-de-camp bonuses equal to one-half of the bonuses he gains from challenge, including bonuses derived from the cavalier&rsquo;s order. If the aide-de-camp is also a cavalier and challenges the same target, these bonuses do not stack. Like the esquire, his aide-decamp takes a &ndash;2 penalty to Armor Class against attacks from creatures other than the challenged opponent. This ability replaces expert trainer.<br /><br />Banner (Ex): An aide-de-camp can carry an esquire&rsquo;s banner for him and still grant allies within range the banner&rsquo;s bonuses. While doing so the aide-de-camp gains double the normal morale bonuses provided by the banner. This ability modifies banner.<br /><br />Avenge Me (Ex): At 11th level, whenever the esquire is killed, dying, stunned, dazed, or otherwise unable to take actions, his aide-de-camp gains the full benefits of the esquire&rsquo;s challenge and order abilities against all creatures that attacked the esquire in the previous round. If the aidede- camp is also a cavalier and challenges the same target, these bonuses do not stack. These benefits last until the esquire regains the ability to take actions, or until the aide-de-camp or the triggering opponents are killed.<br /><br />If his aide-de-camp is killed, dying, or otherwise unable to take actions the esquire may declare one creature of his choice that attacked the aide-de-camp in the past round as his quarry; this functions identically to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ranger\">ranger class ability</a>. These bonuses last until the aide-de-camp recovers or until the cavalier or the triggering opponents are killed. This ability replaces mighty charge.<br /><br />Fight As One (Ex): At 20th level, the shared challenge ability increases in power, granting the aide-de-camp full benefit of the esquire&rsquo;s challenge. In addition, if the esquire and aide-de-camp both confirm a critical hit against the same target within the same round, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 +1/2 the esquire&rsquo;s cavalier level + the esquire&rsquo;s Charisma bonus) or be staggered for 1d4 rounds.

Spellscar drifters have made themselves at home in these badlands. When not scouring the desert for forgotten treasures or magic hidden by the region&rsquo;s shifting magic-dead zones, a Spellscar drifter might hire himself out as a guide, bodyguard, or assassin. There are even a few Spellscar drifters who are temporarily deputized by the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar to perform law enforcement tasks beyond the reach of the city&rsquo;s normal constabulary. Spellscar drifters are self-reliant and always keep their firearms loaded&mdash;in the Spellscar Desert, a rider with a slow draw doesn&rsquo;t live long.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Spellscar drifters are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, the whip, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor. This replaces the cavalier&rsquo;s normal weapon and armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Have Gun: At 1st level, the Spellscar drifter gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Amateur%20Gunslinger\">Amateur Gunslinger</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Gunsmithing\">Gunsmithing</a>&nbsp;as bonus feats. The Spellscar drifter uses his Charisma modifier (minimum 1) in place of his Wisdom modifier when determining his maximum grit points and for any other abilities which use grit. Additionally, he also gains a battered gun identical to the one gained by the gunslinger. This ability replaces tactician.<br /><br />Daring Deeds (Ex): At 3rd level, a Spellscar drifter gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Rapid%20Reload\">Rapid Reload</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. The Spellscar drifter must choose a firearm to associate with this feat. Additionally, the Spellscar drifter can select one additional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/GunslingerDeeds.aspx\">1st-level gunslinger deed</a>&nbsp;which he can use with his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Amateur%20Gunslinger\">Amateur Gunslinger</a>&nbsp;feat. This ability replaces cavalier&rsquo;s charge.<br /><br />Worn Banner (Ex): At 5th level, a Spellscar drifter can choose to use his hat as his banner. If the drifter does not wear a hat, another iconic accessory&mdash;such as an eyemask, bandana, or distinguishing coat&mdash;can instead serve as his banner. In all other ways, this ability functions as and replaces the banner cavalier ability.<br /><br />Bonus Feats: At 6th level, and at every 6 levels thereafter, a Spellscar drifter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?Category=Combat\">combat</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?Category=Grit\">grit feats</a>, and the Spellscar drifter must meet the prerequisites as normal. This replaces the cavalier&rsquo;s normal bonus feats.<br /><br />Notorious Deeds (Ex): At 9th level, a Spellscar drifter can select two additional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/GunslingerDeeds.aspx\">gunslinger deeds</a>&nbsp;which he can use with his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Amateur%20Gunslinger\">Amateur Gunslinger</a>&nbsp;feat. The Spellscar drifter can choose one deed from the list of deeds available to 3rd-level gunslingers and one from the list available to 7th-level gunslingers. This ability replaces greater tactician.<br /><br />Old Reliable (Ex): At 11th level, whenever a Spellscar drifter declares a challenge, the threat range of the Spellscar drifter&rsquo;s firearm is doubled against the target of his challenge. This increase only affects one weapon and does not stack with other effects that increase the threat range of the weapon. In addition, if the Spellscar drifter rolls a misfire during his challenge, the Spellscar drifter can spend 1 grit point to reroll the attack roll. The Spellscar drifter must accept the results of the second roll, even if it is worse. This ability replaces mighty charge.<br /><br />Spell Severed (Ex): At 12th level, a Spellscar drifter becomes permanently marked by long exposure to the Spellscar Desert. The Spellscar drifter gains spell resistance equal to 10 + his character level. The Spellscar drifter can drop this spell resistance for 1 round as a standard action, or he can spend 1 grit point to drop it as a swift action. This ability replaces demanding challenge.<br /><br />Infamous Deeds (Ex): At 17th level, a Spellscar drifter can select two additional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/GunslingerDeeds.aspx\">gunslinger deeds</a>&nbsp;which he can use with his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Amateur%20Gunslinger\">Amateur Gunslinger</a>&nbsp;feat. The Spellscar drifter can choose one deed from the list of deeds available to 7th-level gunslingers and one from the list available to 11th-level gunslingers.

Huntmasters are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, plus the net and whip.<br /><br />Bestial Challenge (Ex): Whenever a huntmaster issues a challenge, both he and his hunting pack gain the bonuses and penalties associated with his challenge. This modifies the challenge ability.<br /><br />Hunting Pack (Ex): At 1st level, a huntmaster forms a close bond with an animal companion. This animal companion functions as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Companion\">druid&rsquo;s animal companion</a>, using the cavalier&rsquo;s level as his effective druid level.

This ability replaces mount.<br /><br />Tactician (Ex): A huntmaster&rsquo;s tactician ability affects only his hunting pack, not other allies. This modifies the tactician, greater tactician, and master tactician abilities.<br /><br />Takedown (Ex): At 3rd level, a huntmaster&rsquo;s dog can make a free trip or dirty trick (entangled) combat maneuver after a successful melee attack. A huntmaster&rsquo;s bird can make a free dirty trick (dazzled or deafened) combat maneuver after a successful melee attack; if the target is already dazzled, the bird can choose dirty trick (blinded) instead.

In addition, they can flank a creature with improved uncanny dodge if the huntmaster has at least 4 more levels than the target.

Once per day, while his banner is displayed, the standard bearer can wave it through the air as a full-round action, granting all allies within 60 feet temporary hit points equal to 1/2 his cavalier level, and a +2 morale bonus on their next damage rolls.

This ability replaces mount.<br /><br />Squad Commander (Ex): At 3rd level, a constable can spend 1 minute laying out a plan to activate the tactician ability without having it count against his number of uses per day. The ability must be triggered within 1 hour of the plan being made, and the benefits last for 1 minute per cavalier level he has.

Both mount and rider brim with new growth, sporting bright flowers, whipping tendrils, clouds of pollen, and other manifestations charged with nature&rsquo;s power. This archetype is typically available only to vine leshys, but with the GM&rsquo;s permission, other races can take it as well.<br /><br />Plant Mount (Ex): A verdivant buds off and cultivates his vines into an animal form, imbuing them with limited intelligence. The verdivant selects a mount appropriate for his size as normal, but this mount is a plant with the leshy subtype and has the same immunities as a vine leshy.<br /><br />A verdivant can absorb and regrow his plant mount. This can either replace a slain mount or change a mount&rsquo;s form; the new form must still be a suitable mount the verdivant is capable of riding. Either function takes 1 week, after which the newly regrown mount immediately benefits from its special abilities.<br /><br />At 4th level, regrowing a mount takes only 24 hours.<br /><br />This alters mount and replaces expert trainer.<br /><br />Effloresce: At 2nd level, a verdivant can use a standard action to create efflorescences, explosive growths fed by his animating spirit. A verdivant can use this ability three times per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 cavalier levels he has beyond 2nd. A verdivant can apply effloresces to himself, or his plant mount if it is adjacent. Efflorescences last for 1 round per cavalier level, and a verdivant can have at most two efflorescences in effect at a time. A verdivant can end an efflorescence during his turn as a free action.<br /><br />At 6th level, a verdivant can effloresce as a move action. At 12th level, a verdivant can effloresce as a swift action, and he can have two efflorescences in effect simultaneously. At 17th level, a verdivant can effloresce twice as part of the same action.<br /><br />At 2nd level, a verdivant can use the following efflorescences.<br /><br />Shieldvines (Ex): Allies within 10 feet do not provoke attacks of opportunity when leaving threatened squares; this increases to 20 feet at 9th level.<br /><br />Floatflower (Ex): Allies within 10 feet ignore the effects of nonmagical difficult terrain. At 9th level, they also gain the effects of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=air%20walk\">air walk</a>&nbsp;while within 10 feet of the verdivant.<br /><br />At 5th level, a verdivant gains the following efflorescences.<br /><br />Innervating Pollen (Ex): The verdivant and his allies within 30 feet gain a competence bonus either on attack rolls or to saving throws (the verdivant&rsquo;s choice; all allies gain the same benefit) equal to one-third the verdivant&rsquo;s cavalier level.<br /><br />Bolsterbloom (Su): The verdivant and his allies within 30 feet gain fast healing 1; this fast healing increases by 1 at 9th level, and again at 14th and 17th levels.<br /><br />At 9th level, a verdivant gains the following efflorescences.<br /><br />Charged Blossoms (Su): Choose an energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The verdivant and his allies within 10 feet gain energy resistance 10 to the chosen energy type. At 14th level this affects allies within 20 feet, and the energy resistance increases to 20.<br /><br />Slipstrands (Su): The verdivant and his allies within 10 feet are affected by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=freedom%20of%20movement\">freedom of movement</a>; this increases to 20 feet at 17th level.<br /><br />At 14th level, a verdivant gains the following efflorescences.<br /><br />Ambrosia (Su): The efflorescence temporarily suppresses enchantments, transmutations, and curses on the verdivant and his allies within 30 feet, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=break%20enchantment\">break enchantment</a>&nbsp;with a caster level equal to the verdivant&rsquo;s cavalier level. Affected creatures ignore the effects of such conditions for the duration of the efflorescence, after which the conditions&rsquo; full effects resume.

These honor guards are sometimes merely ornamental, performing their functions on a ceremonial basis, but a surprising number are capable, deadly opponents, able to take down a threat long before their liege knows of the danger. To be an honor guard is to constantly place one&rsquo;s self in harm&rsquo;s way, and to always be willing to lay down one&rsquo;s life at a moment&rsquo;s notice.<br /><br />Sworn Defense (Ex): At 1st level, whenever an honor guard issues a challenge, he can select one ally as his ward for the duration of the challenge. Whenever the honor guard is adjacent to his ward, he takes a &ndash;1 penalty to Armor Class, and the ward receives a +1 dodge bonus to AC. This modifies the challenge ability<br /><br />Intercept (Ex): At 3rd level, an honor guard learns to better disrupt the attacks of his enemies.

In addition, whenever the honor guard uses the aid another action to increase an ally&rsquo;s Armor Class, the bonus to Armor Class granted by the aid another action increases by +1. This ability replaces cavalier&rsquo;s charge.<br /><br />Warding Charge (Ex): At 11th level, an honor guard can flash across the battlefield to protect his ward against the target of his challenge. Whenever the target of the honor guard&rsquo;s challenge makes an attack against his ward, the honor guard can move up to his speed and make a single melee attack against the target of his challenge as an immediate action. This movement and attack can be made as a charge if the movement qualifies. This ability replaces mighty charge.<br /><br />Defensive Challenge (Ex): At 12th level, whenever an honor guard declares a challenge, his target must pay particular attention to him and his ability to intercept attacks. As long as the target is within the threatened area of the cavalier, it takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls against anyone other than the honor guard.

He tramples his enemies down, leaving twisted bodies in his wake, and fear rides with him.<br /><br />Brute Steed (Ex): A fell rider&rsquo;s mount is unusually large and fierce. It gains a +2 bonus to Strength, but takes a &ndash;2 penalty to Dexterity. This otherwise works like the cavalier&rsquo;s mount ability and alters that ability.<br /><br />Rampage (Ex): At 3rd level, a fell rider gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Trample\">Trample</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. The fell rider receives a +2 bonus on overrun attempts made while mounted. In addition, his mount gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when making hoof attacks or using the trample monster ability, even when not overrunning. This ability replaces cavalier&rsquo;s charge.<br /><br />Dread Rider (Ex): At 4th level, a fell rider gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his level on Intimidate checks made while mounted.

This ability replaces banner.<br /><br />Deadly Rampage (Ex): At 11th level, a mounted fell rider no longer provokes attacks of opportunity when he attempts to overrun a creature. He can make a single melee attack against the creature as a free action if the overrun attempt succeeds. This ability replaces mighty charge.<br /><br />Terror (Ex): At 14th level, a fell rider can rear up his mount as a standard action, spreading terror among his enemies. Enemies within 60 feet who can see the fell rider must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the fell rider&rsquo;s level + the fell rider&rsquo;s Charisma modifier) or be shaken for 1 round per level the fell rider possesses. Creatures with half or fewer Hit Dice than the fell rider become frightened instead. An opponent that succeeds at the saving throw is immune to that fell rider&rsquo;s terror ability for 24 hours.

Each attempt made against a creature after the first receives a cumulative &ndash;5 penalty (for example, the fourth overrun attempt would be at a &ndash;15 penalty). If any overrun attempt fails, the fell rider cannot make further overrun attempts that round.

While in that community or within 25 miles of it, she adds half her cavalier level (minimum 1) on Intimidate, Knowledge (local), and Sense Motive skill checks (as well as any other law-related skill checks, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion). Whenever she advances in level, the range within which she gains this bonus expands by another 25 miles&mdash;50 miles at 2nd level, 75 miles at 3rd level, and so forth. This bonus on Intimidate checks increases by 2 when she enters a community within this area that she hasn&rsquo;t visited for 1 week or more.<br /><br />At 9th level and 17th level, the circuit judge can select another community within the range in which she gains this ability&rsquo;s bonus. She can measure from that community (as well as previous communities) to determine whether she gains this ability&rsquo;s bonus on the relevant skill checks.<br /><br />This ability replaces tactician, greater tactician, and master tactician.<br /><br />Sentence (Ex): Once per day as a swift action, the circuit judge can choose one target within sight to sentence. The circuit judge gains the potential for a variety of bonuses related to that target. The circuit judge chooses the form of these benefits from the following list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Inquisitor\">inquisitor judgments</a>: destruction, justice, protection, purity, or smiting.<br /><br />The benefits of these judgments apply only to the circuit judge and the target&mdash;the protection judgment&rsquo;s bonus to Armor Class, for example, applies only to attacks made by the sentenced target (not any creature who attacks the circuit judge while the judgment is active). Treat the circuit judge&rsquo;s level as her inquisitor level for the purposes of determining how these judgments increase in power. The circuit judge can use this ability twice per day at 1st level, plus two additional times per day for every 3 cavalier levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of 14 times per day at 19th level. She can switch her sentence as a swift action, but doing so expends an additional daily use of this ability.<br /><br />Sentencing a foe requires much of the circuit judge&rsquo;s concentration. The circuit judge takes a &ndash;2 penalty to her Armor Class, except against attacks made by the target of her sentence.<br /><br />The sentence remains in effect either until the target is dead or unconscious or until the combat ends. Sentences are considered challenges for the purposes of the effects listed in the challenge section describing the cavalier&rsquo;s order.<br /><br />This ability replaces challenge.<br /><br />Double Jeopardy (Ex): At 12th level, whenever a circuit judge sentences a foe, she can gain the benefits of two inquisitor judgments against the foe instead of one. Using this ability does not expend a daily use of sentence.<br /><br />This ability replaces demanding challenge.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Cavalier","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horseshoe.jpg"}

These courtly knights are equally at home in a duel with words or swords.<br /><br />Social Presence (Ex): A courtly knight gains a +1 bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks. At 4th level and every 4 cavalier levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level). A courtly knight starts any verbal duel with an extra edge she can use for only the presence tactic unless she is at a significant or extreme disadvantage in the duel.<br /><br />This ability replaces tactician.<br /><br />Imperious Attitude (Ex): At 9th level, a courtly knight develops a commanding demeanor, and the strength of her conviction is often enough to get others to do as she asks, merely because she expects it to be done. In a social setting, the courtly knight can attempt Diplomacy checks to make a request of a creature whose attitude toward her is unfriendly, provided that creature does not intend to harm or oppose the courtly knight or her allies in the immediate future. Further, whenever she attempts a Diplomacy check to make a request, a courtly knight can first attempt an Intimidate check (DC = 20 + the creature&rsquo;s Charisma modifier).

She does not gain the benefits of her challenge (including any additional benefits granted by her order) when making a grand boast.

Unlike other cavaliers, drakeriders must train their mounts from hatchlings, fighting and toiling alongside their drakes for years through countless struggles before the proud dragons are willing to accept them as riders. Some residents of Triaxus, envious of the close connection between dragonriders and dragons, attempt to emulate this relationship by raising drake hatchlings.

Saurian champions do not deal double damage when charging with a lance (or similar weapon) while mounted. While mounted, a saurian champion cannot attack with ranged weapons other than thrown weapons.<br /><br />Titanic Challenge (Ex): A saurian champion considers only the largest creatures a true challenge. His titanic challenge adds only half his level on damage rolls against Medium or smaller creatures, but he adds a +1 bonus on attack rolls against a target of his challenge that is at least two size categories larger than himself (Huge for Medium saurian champions) and a +2 bonus on attack rolls against a Colossal target of his challenge.<br /><br />This alters challenge.<br /><br />Wild Warrior (Ex): A saurian champion hails from primeval lands where the civilized orders hold little sway.

This ability replaces banner.<br /><br />Mounted Acrobatics (Ex): At 9th level, an emissary is even more adept at hopping on and off his steed, and even dropping alongside its flanks mid-gallop. He gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Trick%20Riding\">Trick Riding</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. The emissary can employ this feat even when wearing medium armor. This ability replaces greater tactician.<br /><br />Mounted Dervish (Ex): At 14th level, an emissary becomes a fearsome, mobile foe on the battlefield. He gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Mounted%20Skirmisher\">Mounted Skirmisher</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. In addition, whenever the emissary is mounted and takes the charge action, he adds 10 feet to his mount&rsquo;s speed. This ability replaces greater banner.<br /><br />Erratic Charge (Ex): At 20th level, an emissary learns to ride through the thick of combat, striking and then moving away with blinding speed. Whenever the emissary is mounted and takes the charge action, he can first move 10 feet and make a melee attack. This first attack is not a charge, but a regular melee attack, and the movement counts toward the total allowed movement for the round. After making this attack, the emissary must still move in a straight line to reach the target of his charge, and he takes a &ndash;5 penalty on the attack roll for the attack at the end of his charge. This ability replaces supreme charge.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Cavalier","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/horseshoe.jpg"}
