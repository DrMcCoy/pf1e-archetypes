This legacy has been handed down from the tradition&rsquo;s Vudrani founders.<br /><br />Weapon Proficiency: An iron-ring striker is not proficient with martial weapons.<br /><br />This alters the magus&rsquo;s weapon proficiency.<br /><br />Diminished Spellcasting: An iron-ring striker has one fewer spell slot of each level than a regular magus. If this reduces his number of spell slots of a particular level to 0, he can cast spells of that level only if his Intelligence allows bonus spells of that level.<br /><br />This alters the magus&rsquo;s spellcasting.<br /><br />Arcane Pool (Su): An iron-ring striker can use his arcane pool to enhance his unarmed strikes as if they were manufactured weapons. At 5th level, he can use these bonuses to add any of the following weapon special abilities to his weapons or unarmed strikes: <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Advancing\">advancing</a>, <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Cruel\">cruel</a>, <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Defending\">defending</a>, <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Guardian\">guardian</a>, <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Impact\">impact</a>, <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Invigorating\">invigorating</a>, <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Mimetic\">mimetic</a>, <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Negating\">negating</a>, <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Speed\">speed</a>, and <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Vicious\">vicious</a>.<br /><br />This alters arcane pool.<br /><br />Unarmed Spellstrike (Su): An iron-ring striker gains the magus spellstrike class feature. However, an iron-ring striker can deliver spells with spellstrike with only unarmed strikes.<br /><br />This alters spellstrike.<br /><br />Unarmed Strike: An iron-ring striker gains <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike\">Improved Unarmed Strike</a> as a bonus feat. He deals unarmed strike damage as per a <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Monk\">monk</a> of his level. For the purpose of determining damage, these levels stack with levels from any other class that grants increased damage to unarmed strikes.<br /><br />Bonus Feat: At 5th level, an iron-ring striker must select his bonus feat from this list: <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Improved%20Bull%20Rush\">Improved Bull Rush</a>, <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Improved%20Disarm\">Improved Disarm</a>, <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Improved%20Sunder\">Improved Sunder</a>, or <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Improved%20Trip\">Improved Trip</a>. He doesn&rsquo;t need to meet the prerequisites normally required for these feats.<br /><br />This modifies the bonus feat gained at 5th level.<br /><br />Empower Combat (Su): At 7th level, an iron-ring striker learns to use magic to grant himself the power of a larger creature. As a standard action, he can expend one non-cantrip prepared magus spell to treat his size as if it were larger for the purposes of determining the size modifier to his CMB and CMD, as well as which creatures he can affect with combat maneuvers. For every level of the spell he sacrifices, his effective size increases by one step, up to a maximum of Colossal. For every two effective size increments he increases, he gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, to a maximum of +6. This does not change the iron-ring striker&rsquo;s actual size. This effect lasts for 1 minute per level of the spell sacrificed.<br /><br />This replaces medium armor and heavy armor.<br /><br />Spell Maneuvers (Su): At 7th level, as long as an iron-ring striker is wearing light armor or no armor, he can use his unarmed spellstrike ability as part of a combat maneuver check to bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip an opponent.<br /><br />This replaces knowledge pool.<br /><br />Reflexive Spell Maneuver (Ex): At 16th level, when an iron-ring striker is the target of a combat maneuver check to bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip, as an immediate action he can target his attacker with a magus spell he has prepared with a range of touch. If the spell would normally require a touch attack, an iron-ring striker can attempt a combat maneuver check for this attack instead. The iron-ring striker must be wearing light armor or no armor to use reflexive spell maneuver.<br /><br />This replaces counterstrike.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Magus","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-magenta-3.jpg","_id":"19dnkaH06A5tCRND"}

Many elven magi do not consider themselves masters of a blend of martial and magical talents, but rather a sub-category of wizards who study the effect of physical movement and techniques upon spellcasting ability. They believe their ability to cast spells while fighting is an outgrowth of the concept of the \"spell dance,\" which itself is just another kind of wizardry. A spell dancer has the following class features.<br /><br />Class Skills: A spell dancer adds Acrobatics and Perform (dance) to his list of class skills and removes Intimidate and Ride from his list of class skills.<br /><br />Spell Dance (Su): At 1st level, a spell dancer gains the ability to expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to gain a +10 enhancement bonus to his movement rate and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity provoked by moving through threatened spaces for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 1st, the spell dancer gains another +10 enhancement bonus to movement and +2 to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked from movement.<br /><br />At 5th level, once per spell dance as a swift action, the spell dancer may use one of the following on himself as a swift action: blur, fly, or haste. These abilities last for 1 round. At 9th level, the spell dancer may instead take a swift action to use dimension door as a spell-like ability once during a spelldance. At 13th level, the spell dancer may instead choose to take a swift action to gain freedom of movement for 1d4 rounds.<br /><br />This ability replaces the magus&rsquo;s ability to expend points from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon he is holding magic bonuses for 1 minute.<br /><br />Arcane Movement (Su): At 5th level, whenever a spell dancer casts a magus spell, he gains a competence bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, and Stealth checks equal to the spell&rsquo;s level until the beginning of his next turn. This ability replaces the bonus feat a magus receives at 5th level.<br /><br />Dance of Avoidance (Su): At 7th level, while wearing light armor or no armor, a spell dancer gains a +2 insight bonus to Armor Class. This ability replaces the medium armor class feature.<br /><br />Greater Dance of Avoidance (Su): At 13th level, while wearing light armor or no armor, a spell dancer&rsquo;s insight bonus to Armor Class increases to +4.

By forming weapons with her mind, she always has the right tool for any situation.<br /><br />Spells: A mindblade casts spells from the magus spell list as psychic spells. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mindblade must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The saving throw DC to resist a mindblade&rsquo;s spell is equal to 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + the mindblade&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />Like other spellcasters, a mindblade can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her magus level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&ndash;3 on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).<br /><br />At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mindblade can learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the mindblade loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&rsquo;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and the new spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the mindblade can cast.<br /><br />A mindblade need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any magus spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell&rsquo;s level.<br /><br />This ability replaces the magus&rsquo;s spellcasting.<br /><br />Psychic Pool (Su): A mindblade gains a psychic pool, similar to a normal magus&rsquo;s arcane pool. At 1st level, a mindblade can expend 1 point from her psychic pool as a standard action to manifest a light melee weapon of her choice, formed from psychic energy. By spending 2 points, the mindblade can manifest a one-handed melee weapon, and by spending 3 points, she can manifest a two-handed melee weapon (but not a double weapon). This psychic weapon can last indef initely, but it vanishes if it leaves the mindblade&rsquo;s hand. The mindblade can dismiss a held psychic weapon as a free action. When a psychic weapon vanishes, the mindblade regains the psychic energy used to create it. She can maintain only one weapon at a time.<br /><br />At 1st level, a psychic weapon counts as a magic weapon of whatever type the mindblade selected, with a +1 enhancement bonus. At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the weapon&rsquo;s enhancement bonus increases by 1, up to maximum of +5 at 12th level. Starting at 5th level, the mindblade can add any of the weapon special abilities listed in the arcane pool class feature in place of these bonuses, although the weapon must maintain at least a +1 bonus to benefit from any weapon special abilities. At 15th and 18th levels, the weapon gains an additional +1 enhancement bonus, which the mindblade can spend only on weapon special abilities.<br /><br />This ability replaces arcane pool, and counts as arcane pool for the purpose of feats, abilities, and class features.<br /><br />Psychic Access (Su): At 4th level, the mindblade gains access to an expanded spell list. She adds two spells from the psychic class spell list to her magus spell list as magus spells of the same spell level. These must be spells of levels the mindblade is able to cast. At 7th, 11th, 14th, and 19th levels, she adds two more psychic class spells to her spell list, following the same restrictions. When a mindblade takes the spell blending arcana, she gains spells from the psychic class spell list instead of the wizard spell list.<br /><br />This ability replaces spell recall, knowledge pool, improved spell recall, greater spell combat, and greater spell access.<br /><br />Dual Weapons (Su): At 7th level, a mindblade can maintain two psychic weapons at a time or a psychic double weapon, though each weapon (or each end of a double weapon) has an enhancement bonus 1 lower than normal. Starting at 12th level, each of the two psychic weapons (or each end of a double weapon) instead has an enhancement bonus 2 lower than normal. When using two-weapon fighting with two psychic weapons or a psychic double weapon, the mindblade can use her spell combat ability as though she had a hand free. This ability replaces medium armor.<br /><br />Rapid Manifest (Su): At 8th level, a mindblade can manifest a psychic weapon as a swift action. This ability replaces improved spell combat.<br /><br />Dual Manifest (Su): At 13th level, a mindblade can manifest two psychic weapons with the same action. She must pay the cost for both weapons. Also, when wielding a weapon two-handed, she can use her spell combat ability as though she had a hand free. This ability replaces heavy armor.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Magus","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-magenta-3.jpg","_id":"4bsCUdFKTg5hOKX9"}
{"name":"Magus (Deep Marshal)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9i8l?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Arcane-Anthology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arcane Anthology pg. 28</a><br />According to dwarven legend, the first deep marshals were handpicked by King Taargick himself to create massive tunnels to aid in the dwarven exodus to Golarion&rsquo;s surface during the Quest for Sky. Largely unseen by visitors, the deep marshals have survived into the modern era as keepers, protectors, and repairers of the myriad of stony passages that travel around, through, and under the Five Kings Mountains. Although the vast majority of deep marshals are dwarves, a few non-dwarves have earned enough trust to be trained as deep marshals, or have learned the same techniques from studying old dwarven spellbooks.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A deep marshal is proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A deep marshal can cast magus spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal spell failure chance. In addition, a deep marshal gains the heavy armor magus ability at 9th level. This ability alters the magus&rsquo;s armor proficiencies, the medium armor class feature, and the heavy armor class feature.<br /><br />Deep Spellcasting: A deep marshal learns numerous arcane secrets involving the shaping and warding of earth and stone. She adds the following sorcerer/wizard spells to her magus spell list as magus spells of the same level: crafter&rsquo;s curseAPG, crafter&rsquo;s fortuneAPG, erase, expeditious excavationAPG, fabricate, greater make whole (Technology Guide 10), knock, major creation, make whole, mending, minor creation, move earth, passwall, stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, and all 0- through 6th-level sorcerer/wizard spells of the abjuration school. She must still add such spells to her spellbook to prepare them. If a spell appears on both the magus and sorcerer/wizard spell lists, the magus uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. A deep marshal cannot cast spells from the enchantment, illusion, or necromancy school and she cannot activate spellcompletion or spell-trigger magic items that use spells from those schools (without making a successful Use Magic Device check). This alters the magus&rsquo;s spellcasting.<br /><br />Bound by Tradition: A deep marshal is limited in how she can use her arcane powers. Her arcane pool has a number of points equal to 1/3 her magus level (minimum 1) + her Intelligence modifier. Furthermore, she cannot use her arcane pool to grant an enhancement bonus or weapon special ability to a weapon she is holding unless it is a battleaxe, heavy pick, warhammer, or weapon with the word &ldquo;dwarven&rdquo; in its name. She can use her spell combat or spellstrike abilities only with such weapons. This alters arcane pool, spell combat, and spellstrike.<br /><br />Miner&rsquo;s Focus (Su/Ex): At 3rd level, a deep marshal can use the magical properties of her weapon in order to augment her spellcasting. Whenever she casts a magus spell while wielding a magic battleaxe, heavy pick, warhammer, or weapon with the word &ldquo;dwarven&rdquo; in its name, she adds half the weapon&rsquo;s enhancement bonus to the her caster level (minimum +1). When attempting a caster level check to overcome spell resistance, she instead adds her weapon&rsquo;s full enhancement bonus.<br /><br />In addition, she is treated as having a number of ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Profession (miner) equal to her magus level, and she attempts Profession (miner) checks using her Intelligence modifier instead of her Wisdom modifier.<br /><br />This ability replaces the magus arcana gained at 3rd level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Magus","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-magenta-3.jpg","_id":"6CurATICVEKgjr7h"}

Many of the organization&rsquo;s traditionalists hold prejudices against those who rely upon martial skills, and this prejudice has bled over to those who mix magic with combat, such as eldritch knights and magi. With the organization&rsquo;s recent change to its traditions, though, its numbers have grown more welcoming of these traditions, and magic in particular, have developed a unique method of incorporating their lore.<br /><br />When a magus joins the ranks of the Cyphermages, she can learn the art of infusing her arcane pool with the secrets of ancient Thassilonian magic. Such an individual becomes known as a sigilus. While the mysteries of ancient Thassilon drive her spellcraft, the sigilus makes little effort to understand the academic and philosophic aspects of runes. Instead, she focuses almost entirely upon their practical application.<br /><br />A sigilus manipulates the discoveries of wizards and other more sagacious Cyphermages, using those findings to create special sigils that allow her to transfer spell effects into different objects for later use. Her craft builds upon traditions founded by the runelords that allowed them to infuse magic into their flesh, but rather than infusing magic into her body, the sigilus infuses it into a weapon. More interested in the exploration of Thassilonian ruins than academic research, sigiluses serve the Cyphermages by engaging in fieldwork and recovering artifacts. They work alongside more studious Cyphermages, sometimes serving as bodyguards or as regulatory agents who make sure no member gains too much power through the acquisition of potent Thassilonian secrets.<br /><br />Inscribe Rune (Su): At 2nd level, a sigilus learns how to magically inscribe a Thassilonian rune onto a weapon. The rune to be inscribed must be chosen from the seven runes that symbolize the seven schools of Thassilonian magic (see page 63). Note that due to the nature of magus spells, certain runes (and thus certain schools of magic) are more appropriate for inscription than others&mdash;the runes for conjuration, evocation, illusion, and transmutation are the strongest choices, while those for abjuration, enchantment, and necromancy are less enticing. Inscribing a rune takes 10 minutes.<br /><br />Once a weapon has been infused with a rune, the sigilus becomes more adept at using her spell combat ability with spells of that rune&rsquo;s school. Her penalty on attack rolls when using spell combat is reduced by 1 (to &ndash;1) when she casts a spell from the same school as her inscribed rune, but is increased by 2 (to &ndash;4) when she uses spell combat with a spell not from her inscribed rune&rsquo;s school. As long as she has a rune inscribed on her weapon in this manner, she cannot use spells from that rune&rsquo;s opposition schools at all with spell combat.<br /><br />The sigilus can maintain only a single inscribed rune on a weapon at any time; if she inscribes a new rune on a weapon, the previously inscribed rune fades.<br /><br />This ability replaces spellstrike.<br /><br />Inscribe Sihedron (Su): At 7th level, a sigilus learns to inscribe the Sihedron rune (the sevenpointed star that symbolizes all seven schools of Thassilonian magic) on a suit of light armor she wears. When she does so, her armor becomes physically empowered with defensive magic, granting her energy resistance 5 to two energy types of her choice selected from acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic, and increasing the armor&rsquo;s armor bonus by 1. (Note that this increase is an armor bonus increase, and thus stacks with any enhancement bonus a suit of magic light armor may have.) Inscribing the Sihedron rune in this way becomes part of the sigilus&rsquo;s spell preparation ritual&mdash;she can inscribe a Sihedron rune in this way once per day as a result. Each day she inscribes the Sihedron rune, she can change the two types of energy resistance it grants as she wishes.<br /><br />At 13th level, an inscribed Sihedron rune grants energy resistance 10 to one energy type and energy resistance 5 to two other energy types, and its armor bonus increases to +2.<br /><br />A Sihedron rune can be inscribed only on light armor&mdash;it cannot be inscribed on medium or heavy armor, even if the magus later gains proficiency with medium or heavy armor.<br /><br />This ability replaces medium armor and heavy armor.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Magus","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-magenta-3.jpg","_id":"ABnyXEtHKTe8sOLw"}

If this reduces his number of spell slots of a particular level to zero, he can cast spells of that level only if his Intelligence allows bonus spells of that level.<br /><br />This alters the magus&rsquo;s spellcasting.<br /><br />Golem Arm (Ex): A Jistkan artificer begins play with a golem arm grafted in place of one of his arms. The golem arm is a masterwork weapon that is treated as an unarmed strike and deals damage as if he were a monk 2 levels lower than his class level (minimum 1st level). The golem arm is made from basic parts and mundane materials that grant no additional benefits. A Jistkan artificer can recreate his golem arm from other materials by spending 1 day and paying an additional +50% of the normal cost of the special material used in the creation of this new golem arm. For the purposes of determining the weapon type and weight for special materials, the golem arm is treated as a heavy mace. If a Jistkan artificer recreates his golem arm, any previously used special materials are destroyed. The arm gains no benefits from items that enhance unarmed strikes, such as an amulet of mighty fists.<br /><br />At 1st level, a Jistkan artificer can use his arcane pool to enhance his unarmed strikes as if they were manufactured weapons. At 5th level, he can use this ability to add any of the following special abilities to his unarmed strikes: corrosive, corrosive burst, defending, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, impact, shock, shocking burst, or thundering. At 11th level, he gains access to the following special abilities: brilliant energy and speed.<br /><br />This alters arcane pool.<br /><br />Improved Unarmed Strike: A Jistkan artificer gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. He prepares one fewer cantrip per day than normal.<br /><br />This alters cantrips.<br /><br />Empowered Arm (Ex): At 3rd level, a Jistkan artificer&rsquo;s golem arm is treated as a magic weapon and gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 at 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a total bonus of +5 at 19th level.<br /><br />This replaces the magus arcana gained at 3rd level.<br /><br />Unarmed Spellstrike (Su): A Jistkan artificer can use spellstrike to deliver spells only when attacking with his unarmed strikes.<br /><br />This alters spellstrike.<br /><br />Magus Arcana: A Jistkan artificer gains access to the following arcana in addition to those normally available to the magus. He cannot select any arcana more than once.<br /><br />Break Spell (Ex): A Jistkan artificer can use his arm to disrupt spells targeted at him. When a ranged attack generated by a spell effect targets the Jistkan artificer, he can spend a point from his arcane pool to attempt a melee attack roll as an attack of opportunity. If the result is greater than the total attack roll of the ranged attack, the attack is negated. Spell effects that do not require attack rolls cannot be deflected. The magus must be at least 13th level and have the shielding arm arcana before selecting this arcana.<br /><br />Flurrying Arm (Ex): A Jistkan artificer can improve his golem arm to attack faster. He gains the flurry of blows monk class ability, treating his class level as his monk level. A Jistkan artificer makes only one additional attack when he uses flurry of blows. The magus must be at least 11th level to select this arcana.<br /><br />Sharpened Arm (Ex): A Jistkan artificer can rework his arm to more closely resemble a blade. He can choose to deal piercing or slashing damage with his golem arm. When he does so, the golem arm threatens a critical hit on 19&ndash;20. The artificer also adds keen and wounding to his list of arcane pool weapon abilities.<br /><br />Shielding Arm (Ex): A Jistkan artificer learns to deflect blows with his arm. If he is not wielding any other weapons, he gains a shield bonus to his AC equal to his golem arm&rsquo;s enhancement bonus.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Magus","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-magenta-3.jpg","_id":"Ae6PNcyTx533FwbS"}

The original Ten Magic Warriors each directly served Old-Mage Jatembe as guardians, bodyguards, allies, and friends. Tales of their deeds are still told today in the Magaambya, and while they are long gone, the traditions that rose from these tales live on.<br /><br />While the original Ten Magic Warriors championed unusual skills drawn from various arcane spellcasting classes, often combined with martial classes or even prestige classes, the tradition today has been standardized over the course of the intervening centuries into an archetype followed strictly by magi. Even then, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for a Magic Warrior to multiclass with a martial class for a few levels or to become an eldritch knight to further bolster her combat powers. No one path is regarded as canonical for the magi of the Magic Warriors, and they value their diversity, looking to their brothers and sisters constantly for inspiration regarding new ways to defend the Magaambya and the people of the Mwangi Expanse from the multitude of dangers the world has to offer.<br /><br />Class Skills: A Magic Warrior adds Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (nature) to her list of class skills, instead of Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Knowledge (planes).<br /><br />This ability alters the magus&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Nameless Mask (Ex): A Magic Warrior gains strength by hiding her identity behind a mask that represents an animal, but also suffers drawbacks from doing so. While wearing her mask, a Magic Warrior gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against divinations in the scrying subschool. However, NPCs who are unfamiliar with or have a poor opinion of the Magic Warrior tradition have a starting attitude of unfriendly toward the Magic Warrior while she wears her mask. If using the influence system (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue 102), she requires one additional success to increase her influence level over such an NPC.<br /><br />The Magic Warrior cannot ever reveal her name or remove her mask in front of anyone who she has never met before. If she violates this important taboo, she must discard her mask and create or obtain a new mask and wear it before she can gain any benefits that result from wearing her mask.<br /><br />Magic Warrior&rsquo;s Aspect (Su): At 3rd level, as a standard action, a Magic Warrior can gain an aspect of an animal&rsquo;s might by expending 1 point from her arcane pool. The animal must be the same one that the Magic Warrior&rsquo;s mask represents (the animal can change if the Magic Warrior creates or obtains a new mask). The Magic Warrior gains one ability the animal has from the list of abilities given in beast shape I (this ability doesn&rsquo;t allow her to change her size). The ability lasts for 1 minute per class level. This ability replaces the magus arcana gained at 3rd level.<br /><br />Nameless Anonymity (Su): At 8th level, a Magic Warrior&rsquo;s masked identity further protects her from divinations. Once per day, as long as she is in her masked identity, she can cast nondetection on herself, using her masked warrior level as her caster level.<br /><br />A Magic Warrior gains improved spell combat at 14th level instead of at 8th level. She does not gain the magus&rsquo;s greater spell combat.<br /><br />Magaambya Spell Access (Su): At 19th level, a Magic Warrior learns ancient secrets to using natural magic. She learns seven spells from the druid&rsquo;s spell list and places them in her spellbook as magus spells of the same level at which they appear on the druid spell list. She gains one druid spell not on the magus spell list for each of the listed spell levels: 0 level, 1st level, 2nd level, 3rd level, 4th level, 5th level, and 6th level. She can ignore the divine focus component of these spells.<br /><br />This replaces greater spell access.<br /><br />Magus Arcana: The following magus arcana complement the Magic Warrior archetype: accurate strikeUC, arcane accuracy, arcane cloakUC, arcane edgeUC, bane bladeUC, devoted bladeUC, empowered magic, maximized magic, quickened magic, silent magic, spell blending, and still magic.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Magus","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-magenta-3.jpg","_id":"AsB52wAHHrWgL7E8"}

Each esoteric learns to inscribe his spells on his flesh in a complex series of occult symbols and arcane equations.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An esoteric is proficient with simple weapons only. This alters the magus&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiency.<br /><br />Diminished Spellcasting: An esoteric has one fewer spell slot of each level than a regular magus. If this reduces his number of spell slots of a particular level to zero, he can cast spells of that level only if his Intelligence allows bonus spells of that level. This ability alters the magus&rsquo;s spellcasting.<br /><br />Arcane Pool (Su): At 1st level, an esoteric can use his arcane pool to enhance his unarmed strikes as if they were manufactured weapons. At 5th level, he can use these bonuses to add any of the following weapon special abilities to his weapons or unarmed strikes: defending, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, impactUM, shock, shocking burst, speed, or thundering.<br /><br />This ability alters arcane pool.<br /><br />Unarmed Strike: At 1st level, an esoteric gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. He also treats his magus levels as monk levels when determining the amount of damage he deals with his unarmed strikes.<br /><br />Unarmed Spellstrike (Su): At 1st level, an esoteric gains the magus spellstrike class feature. However, an esoteric can deliver spells with spellstrike only with his unarmed strikes. This ability alters spellstrike.<br /><br />Ki Arcana (Su): At 4th level, an esoteric&rsquo;s arcane pool is also considered a ki pool for the purposes of meeting feat and ability requirements. Points from an esoteric&rsquo;s arcane pool can be used for abilities that normally require ki. If an esoteric gains a ki pool, he can use points from his arcane pool and ki pool interchangeably (though not special points such as drunken ki). This ability replaces spell recall.<br /><br />Tattooed Spell (Sp): At 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter, an esoteric can permanently tattoo one spell from his magus spellbook onto his body; the first tattooed spell must be of 2nd level or lower, the second must be of 4th level or lower, and the last can be of any level. The spell that is tattooed must not have an expensive material component or a focus. The esoteric can prepare any tattooed spell without needing his spellbook. Additionally, he can cast each of his tattooed spells as a spell-like ability once per day. When the esoteric uses these spell-like abilities, the tattoo associated with the spell-like ability glows as light for a number of rounds equal to the spell&rsquo;s level. This ability replaces bonus feats.<br /><br />AC Bonus (Ex): At 7th level when an esoteric wears light or no armor, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 13th level. He loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, or while wearing medium or heavy armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load. This ability replaces medium armor and heavy armor.<br /><br />Improved Tattooed Spell (Sp): At 11th level, an esoteric can use each of his spell-like abilities from tattooed spell one additional time per day.

This ability modifies the magus&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Arcane Pool (Su): An eldritch archer&rsquo;s choices of weapon special abilities to apply with arcane pool at 5th level include distance, nimble shotUE, and returning but not dancing, keen, or vorpal. This ability modifies the magus&rsquo;s arcane pool.<br /><br />Ranged Weapon Bond (Ex): At 1st level, an eldritch archer gains a bonded object as per the wizard&rsquo;s arcane bonded object; it must be a ranged weapon, and it can&rsquo;t be used to cast a spell once per day. Holding her bonded item does not prevent the eldritch archer from providing somatic components for her spells.<br /><br />Ranged Spell Combat (Ex): Instead of a light or one-handed melee weapon, an eldritch archer must use a ranged weapon for spell combat. She doesn&rsquo;t need a free hand for ranged spell combat. The eldritch archer cannot accept an attack penalty to gain a bonus on concentration checks to cast a spell defensively. This ability modifies spell combat.<br /><br />Ranged Spellstrike (Su): At 2nd level, whenever an eldritch archer casts a spell that calls for a ranged attack, she can deliver the spell through a ranged weapon she wields as part of a ranged attack. Instead of the free ranged attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, an eldritch archer can make one free ranged attack with a ranged weapon (at her highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. The attack does not increase the spell&rsquo;s range.<br /><br />If the spell can normally affect multiple targets, only a single missile, ray, or effect accompanies each attack; if the spell allows multiple attacks and the eldritch archer can make additional ranged attacks as part of a full-round action with spell combat, one additional ray, missile, or effect from the spell accompanies each subsequent ranged attack the eldritch archer makes in the same round until all attacks allowed by the spell are made. Unused missiles, rays, or effects remaining at the end of the eldritch archer&rsquo;s turn are wasted. This ability alters spellstrike.<br /><br />Focusing Spellstrike (Su): At 16th level, an eldritch archer can use ranged spellstrike to deliver a cone- or line-shaped spell as a ray, affecting only the creature or object struck.

They forsake much of their arcane skill and martial knowledge in exchange for the ability to conjure magical traps to hinder their foes.<br /><br />Class Skills: A spell trapper adds Disable Device to his list of class skills in place of Knowledge (planes).<br /><br />This alters the magus&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Diminished Arcana: A spell trapper treats his effective magus level as 3 lower when determining which arcana he can select. A spell trapper can choose to learn a new trap (see Spell Traps below) in place of learning a new magus arcana. <br /><br />This modifies the magus arcana ability.<br /><br />Spell Traps (Sp): At 4th level, a spell trapper learns how to craft magical traps in exchange for the use of spell slots. These traps work as ranger traps (Ultimate Magic 64), except they always count as spell-like abilities. A spell trap is always considered magical, and is treated as a spell with a spell level equal to 1/3 the spell trapper&rsquo;s class level. A magical trap lasts only 1 hour per level or until triggered, whichever comes first. A trap&rsquo;s DC decreases by 1 for each full hour that passes after it is set. Upon gaining this ability, the spell trapper automatically knows the snare trap.<br /><br />Setting a spell trap is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. If attacked during the course of conjuring a trap, the spell trapper must attempt a concentration check, as though damaged while casting a spell. A trap fills a single 5-foot square, and cannot be placed in the same area as another spell trapper trap or a magical trap such as a glyph of warding. Spell trappers need access to a material component pouch to craft spell traps (unless they have the Eschew Materials feat) and must sacrifice a spell slot to create the trap. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the trap, Disable Device checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid it are equal to 10 + 1/2 the spell trapper&rsquo;s magus level + the spell slot level sacrificed to create the trap. All spell traps are Trigger location, and Reset none.<br /><br />This ability replaces spell recall.<br /><br />Distant Trapping (Sp): At 10th level, a spell trapper can create spell traps at a distance. She can create her traps at close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels) as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.<br /><br />This replaces the fighter training ability.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Magus","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-magenta-3.jpg","_id":"NWmW3sfn0raFsdNK"}

Additionally, a kapenia dancer can wield a bladed scarf as a one-handed melee weapon. A kapenia dancer is not proficient with armor or shields and suffers the normal arcane spell failure chance when casting magus spells while armored.<br /><br />Diminished Spellcasting: A kapenia dancer can cast one fewer spell of each level than normal. If this reduces the number to 0, he can cast spells of that level only if his Intelligence allows bonus spells of that level.<br /><br />Canny Defense (Ex): At 1st level, when a kapenia dancer is wielding a bladed scarf, he gains the canny defense ability.

Less inclined to mix the two than a typical magus, the myrmidarch seeks supremacy with blade, bow, and armor.<br /><br />Diminished Spellcasting: Myrmidarchs cast one fewer spell of each level than normal. If this reduces the number to 0, he may cast spells of that level only if his Intelligence allows bonus spells of that level. <br /><br />Ranged Spellstrike (Su): At 4th level, a myrmidarch can use spellstrike to cast a single-target touch attack ranged spell and deliver it through a ranged weapon attack. Even if the spell can normally affect multiple targets, only a single missile, ray, or effect accompanies the attack. <br /><br />At 11th level, a myrmidarch can spend a full-round action to cast a spell that includes multiple ranged touch attacks and deliver more than one using ranged attacks. The spell must have a casting time of 1 full-round action or less. This functions similarly to the base ability of ranged spellstrike, but the myrmidarch can deliver a number of missiles, rays, or effect up to the number of attacks he could make with a full attack. Attacks beyond the first take penalties as if the myrmidarch were making a full attack. Any effects not used in the round the spell is cast are lost, as are any additional ranged touch attacks the spell would allow beyond the myrmidarch&rsquo;s maximum number of attacks. This ability replaces spell recall and improved spell recall.<br /><br />Weapon Training (Ex): At 6th level, a myrmidarch gains weapon training, as the fighter ability, adding an additional weapon group every six levels after 6th (to a maximum of three groups at 18th level) and increasing the bonus on attack and damage rolls for weapon groups already chosen by +1. This ability replaces the magus arcana normally gained at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.<br /><br />Fighter Training (Ex): At 7th level, a myrmidarch counts his magus level &ndash;3 as his fighter level for the purpose of qualifying for feats (if he has levels in fighter, these levels stack). At 10th level, the myrmidarch treats his magus levels as fighter levels for the purposes of fighter training. This ability replaces knowledge pool and the fighter training the magus gains at 10th level.<br /><br />Armor Training (Ex): At 8th level, a myrmidarch gains armor training, as the fighter ability. At 14th level, he gains armor training 2. This ability replaces improved spell combat and greater spell combat.<br /><br />Armor Mastery (Ex): At 20th level, a myrmidarch gains DR 5/&ndash; when wearing armor.

More than a few who study at Erages Academy follow this path because of the promises of wealth that the city&rsquo;s criminal element makes toward practiced brawlers and smugglers. Greensting slayers have the following class features.<br /><br />Arcane Pool: At 1st level, a greensting slayer can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to add 1d6 points of sneak attack damage to his next melee attack that round. The attack must meet all of the usual prerequisites for making a sneak attack, as the rogue class feature. For every 4 levels beyond 1st, the amount of sneak attack damage dealt by this ability increases by 1d6 (to a maximum of 5d6 at 17th level). If a greensting slayer gets a sneak attack from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.<br /><br />A greensting slayer cannot use his arcane pool to enhance his weapon. This modifies the arcane pool ability.<br /><br />Evasion (Ex): At 7th level, the greensting slayer gains evasion, as the rogue class feature. This replaces the medium armor ability.<br /><br />Improved Evasion (Ex): At 13th level, the greensting slayer gains improved evasion, as the advanced rogue talent of the same name. This replaces the heavy armor ability.<br /><br />Magus Arcana: In addition to the new magus arcana presented below, the following magus arcana complement the greensting slayer archetype: close range, hasted assault, maneuver mastery, pool strike, and silent magic.<br /><br />Dark Shifter (Su): The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a move action to change the target of an ongoing spell effect with the darkness descriptor within 60 feet. The new target must be within the spell&rsquo;s range, using the magus&rsquo;s level as the effective caster level for the purpose of determining the maximum range the effect can be moved from the magus. If the spell effect the magus is moving originated from another creature, the magus must succeed at a caster level check to reposition the effect (DC = 11 + the effect&rsquo;s caster level).

The spell must have the acid, cold, electricity or fire descriptor. This extra energy damage matches the energy damage of the spell.

A card caster can invest cards with enough magic to deal lethal damage even without the Arcane Strike feat so long as he has at least 1 point in his arcane pool.<br /><br />Arcane Pool Focus (Su): A card caster&rsquo;s arcane pool can be used to augment only ranged weapons. At 5th level, a card caster can use his arcane pool to add the following weapon special abilities to ranged weapons: brilliant energy, distance, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, returning, seeking, shock, shocking burst, and speed. He can use his arcane pool to augment an entire harrow deck as if it were ammunition. All cards from a deck enhanced with a special ability, such as flaming, must share the same bonus. This ability modifies arcane pool.<br /><br />Harrowed Spellstrike (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, a card caster can invest a single thrown weapon with a single touch or ranged spell as part of the spell&rsquo;s normal casting time.

This replaces the magus&rsquo;s normal weapon proficiencies.<br /><br />Bonus Feats (Ex): At 1st level, the spire defender gains Combat Expertise and Dodge as bonus feats, even if he doesn&rsquo;t meet the prerequisites. The spire defender is not prof icient in any kind of armor or shield.

Many travel beyond their homelands seeking some method of contacting the archmage Nex, and hope for some excuse to convince the Council of Three and Nine to renew hostilities with the nation of Geb.<br /><br />Medium Armor (Ex): An armored battlemage gains this ability at 1st level instead of 7th. When wearing medium or heavy armor, the armored battlemage gains a +4 bonus on concentration checks to cast defensively. This stacks with the bonus from the Combat Casting feat.<br /><br />This ability replaces spell combat and alters the medium armor ability.<br /><br />Arcane Pool (Su): An armored battlemage cannot spend points from his arcane pool to enhance weapons. Instead, he can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant armor he is wearing a +1 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. For every 4 magus levels he has beyond 1st, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level. These bonuses stack with existing armor enhancement bonuses to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.<br /><br />At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following armor special abilities: balancedUE, bitterUE, fortification (heavy, light, or medium), ghost touch, invulnerability, spell resistance (13, 15, 17, or 19), or spell storingUE. Adding these special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the ability&rsquo;s base price modifier. In addition, the armored battlemage can grant his armor the energy resistance special ability at the cost of a +3 bonus or the improved energy resistance special ability at the cost of a +5 bonus. These special abilities are added to any the armor already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. These bonuses and special abilities are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time the armored battlemage uses this ability. These bonuses do not function if the armor is worn by anyone other than the magus.<br /><br />An armored battlemage can enhance only one suit of armor in this way at one time. If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends.<br /><br />This ability alters arcane pool.<br /><br />Armor Training (Ex): At 3rd level, an armored battlemage gains armor training, as per the fighter ability. At 8th level, he gains armor training 2. At 13th level, he gains armor training 3. At 18th level, he gains armor training 4.<br /><br />This ability replaces the magus arcana gained at 3rd and 18th levels, and improved spell combat.<br /><br />Heavy Armor (Ex): An armored battlemage gains this ability at 7th level instead of 13th.<br /><br />This ability alters heavy armor.<br /><br />Expanded Arcane Pool (Su): At 14th level, the armored battlemage can grant his armor the glamered special ability at the cost of a +2 bonus, the slick or shadow special ability at the cost of a +3 bonus, and the greater slick or greater shadow special ability at the cost of a +5 bonus when using his arcane pool.<br /><br />This ability replaces greater spell combat.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Magus","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-magenta-3.jpg","_id":"nKrNGsGK9lb2LfZP"}

As an immediate action when a spell with the curse descriptor or a curse-style effect (such as a witch&rsquo;s evil eye or misfortune hex or a sea hag&rsquo;s evil eye) targets a creature within 30 feet of him, a hexbreaker can spend 1 point from his arcane pool to attempt to dispel that effect, as if he had cast remove curse.

He can use this arcana after rolling the caster level check, but only before the results are revealed. This can be used with the hexbreaker&rsquo;s repel curse and counter curse abilities.<br /><br />Wracking Dispel (Su): Whenever the hexbreaker successfully dispels a spell using break enchantment, dispel magic, or remove curse, he can expend 1 point from his arcane pool to wrack the original caster with pain, dealing 1d4 points of damage per spell level of the effect dispelled. If the target succeeds at a Will save (DC = 15 + the level of the spell dispelled + the hexbreaker&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier) it takes only 1 point of damage per spell level.

At 5th level and above, he can also add the following shield special abilities: animated, arrow catching, arrow deflection, bashing, blinding, fortification (any), reflecting, spell resistance (any). <br /><br />Sorcerous Shield (Ex): At 1st level, skirnirs are proficient with all types of shields, including tower shields, and do not suffer an arcane spell failure chance when casting magus spells while using a shield.

He may also use a touch attack or shield bash with his shield in conjunction with any pool strike magus arcana.

{"name":"Magus (Bladebound)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Magic pg. 47</a><br />A select group of magi are called to carry a black blade&mdash;a sentient weapon of often unknown and possibly unknowable purpose. These weapons become valuable tools and allies, as both the magus and weapon typically crave arcane power, but as a black blade becomes more aware, its true motivations manifest, and as does its ability to influence its wielder with its ever-increasing ego.</p>\n<h2>Black Blades</h2>\n<p>A black blade is a particular form of intelligent weapon gained by a magus with the bladebound archetype. There are several ways a magus might gain this weapon. Sometimes it just appears among the magus&rsquo;s possessions, and its origin is a mystery. Other times the magus finds a black blade during an adventure or event of some kind. Sometimes a black blade is passed down generation to generation in an ongoing search for a magus who can unlock its true potential. A black blade is always a one-handed slashing weapon, a rapier, or a sword cane. The magus chooses the blade&rsquo;s type upon gaining the blade, and once chosen, it can&rsquo;t be changed. As a bladebound magus increases in level, his black blade gains power. A black blade is independently conscious but features some personality traits reflecting its wielder. A black blade always has the same alignment as its wielder and even changes its alignment if its wielder does. The blade typically works toward its wielder&rsquo;s goals, but not always without argument or backlash. Each black blade has a mission, and while sometimes two or more black blades will work in concert, each mission is singular in purpose (the black blade&rsquo;s mission is usually up to the GM and the needs of the campaign or the adventure, or a GM can roll randomly for the weapon&rsquo;s purpose using the Intelligent Item Purpose table. Some black blades are very open about their missions, but most are secretive. Certain sages have speculated that an invisible hand or arcane purpose moves these weapons.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Magus Class Level</td>\n<td>Enhancement Bonus</td>\n<td>Int</td>\n<td>Wis/Cha</td>\n<td>Ego</td>\n<td>Special</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd&ndash;4th</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Alertness, black blade strike, telepathy, unbreakable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th&ndash;6th</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Energy attunement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th&ndash;8th</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th&ndash;10th</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>Teleport blade</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th&ndash;12th</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th&ndash;14th</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>Transfer arcana</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th&ndash;16th</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th&ndash;18th</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>Spell defense</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th&ndash;20th</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>Life drinker</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br /><br />Black Blade (Ex): At 3rd level, the bladebound magus&rsquo; gains a powerful sentient weapon called a black blade, whose weapon type is chosen by the magus. A magus with this class feature cannot take the familiar magus arcana, and cannot have a familiar of any kind, even from another class.<br /><br />Instead of the normal arcane pool amount, the bladebound magus&rsquo;s arcane pool has a number of points equal to 1/3 his level (minimum 1) plus his Intelligence bonus. This ability changes the Arcane Pool class feature and replaces the magus arcana gained at 3rd level.<br /><br />Magus Arcana: The following magus arcana complement the bladebound magus archetype: arcane accuracy, broad study, dispelling strike, and reflection.<br /><br />Black Blade Basics: A black blade is bonded to a particular magus, much like a familiar, but in more of a partnership than a master-servant relationship.<br /><br />Intelligence: This is the intelligence score of the black blade. It starts at 10 and increases by 1 for every two levels of the bladebound magus (at 3rd level, 5th level, and so on).<br /><br />Wisdom and Charisma: As the bladebound magus increases in level, so do the Wisdom and Charisma of the black blade. These abilities start at 6 and increase by 1 for every two levels of magus. <br /><br />Ego: A black blade starts with an ego of 5, and that ego increases as the blade becomes more powerful. In cases where a wielder and the black blade come into conflict, like any intelligent item, a black blade can attempt to exert its dominance using the items against characters rules. Due to its flexible and powerful nature, a black blade has a nonstandard ego progression. <br /><br />Languages and Skills: A black blade starts with Common as a language. As the black blade increases in Intelligence, it manifests knowledge of languages and arcane lore. Upon reaching an Intelligence of 12, it gains a bonus language of the GM&rsquo;s choice, and gains 1 rank in Knowledge (arcana). Each time the sword gains a bonus to Intelligence, it gains another language and another rank in Knowledge (arcana). <br /><br />Senses: A black blade is aware of everything around it like a creature that can see and hear. It can be blinded and deafened as if it were a creature. It uses the saving throws of its magus, even if the magus is not currently wielding the black blade.<br /><br />Black Blade Arcane Pool: A black blade has an arcane pool with a number of points equal to 1 + its Intelligence bonus. <br /><br />Black Blade Ability Descriptions: A black blade has special abilities (or imparts abilities to its wielder) depending on the wielder&rsquo;s magus level. The abilities are cumulative. A black blade normally refuses to use any of its abilities when wielded by anyone other than its magus, and acts as a masterwork weapon of its type.<br /><br />Alertness (Ex): While a magus is wielding his black blade, he gains the Alertness feat.<br /><br />Black Blade Strike (Sp): As a free action, the magus can spend a point from the black blade&rsquo;s arcane pool to grant the black blade a +1 bonus on damage rolls for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 1st, this ability gives the black blade another +1 on damage rolls.<br /><br />Telepathy (Su): While a magus is wielding or carrying his black blade, he can communicate telepathically with the blade in a language that the magus and the black blade share. <br /><br />Unbreakable (Ex): As long as it has at least 1 point in its arcane pool, a black blade is immune to the broken condition. If broken, the black blade is unconscious and powerless until repaired. If destroyed, the black blade can be reforged 1 week later through a special ritual that costs 200 gp per magus level. The ritual takes 24 hours to complete.<br /><br />Energy Attunement (Su): At 5th level, as a free action, a magus can spend a point of his black blade&rsquo;s arcane pool to have it deal one of the following types of damage instead of weapon damage: cold, electricity, or fire. He can spend 2 points from the black blade&rsquo;s arcane pool to deal sonic or force damage instead of weapon damage. This effect lasts until the start of the magus&rsquo;s next turn. <br /><br />Teleport Blade (Sp): As a standard action, a magus of 9th level or higher can expend an arcane point from his or his black blade&rsquo;s arcane pool, and can call his black blade from as far as 1 mile away, causing it to instantaneously teleport to his hand. <br /><br />Transfer Arcana (Su): At 13th level, once per day, a magus can attempt to siphon points from his black blade&rsquo;s arcane pool into his own arcane pool. Doing so takes a full-round action and the magus must succeed at a Will saving throw with a DC equal to the black blade&rsquo;s ego. If the magus succeeds, he regains 1 point to his arcane pool for every 2 points he saps from his black blade. If he fails the saving throw, the magus becomes fatigued (but can try again). If he is fatigued, he becomes exhausted instead. He cannot use this ability if he is exhausted.<br /><br />Spell Defense (Sp): A magus of 17th level or higher can expend an arcane point from his weapon&rsquo;s arcane pool as a free action; he then gains SR equal to his black blade&rsquo;s ego until the start of his next turn.<br /><br />Life Drinker (Su): At 19th level, each time the magus kills a living creature with the black blade, he can pick one of the following effects: the black blade restores 2 points to its arcane pool; the black blade restores 1 point to its arcane pool and the magus restores 1 point to his arcane pool; the magus gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the black blade&rsquo;s ego (these temporary hit points last until spent or 1 minute, whichever is shorter). The creature killed must have a number of Hit Dice equal to half the magus&rsquo;s character level for this to occur.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Magus","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-magenta-3.jpg","_id":"oXiVTX7cbLoUduUP"}

These hit points last until expended or until the soul forger next prepares spells. Multiple uses of this ability overlap and do not stack. This ability replaces spell recall.<br /><br />Reforge (Su): At 11th level, as a standard action, a soul forger can restore a number of hit points equal to his magus level to a damaged object by touching it and spending 1 point from his arcane pool.

Each spell selected must be 3 spell levels lower than the highest spell level the beastblade can cast, and can&rsquo;t require a material component that costs more than 1 gp. This ability replaces knowledge pool.<br /><br />Familiar Spellstrike (Su): At 11th level, whenever a beastblade&rsquo;s familiar successfully delivers a touch spell against a creature the magus threatens, the target provokes an attack of opportunity from the magus.

These lightly armored magi use staves for both defense and inflicting their spells upon enemies. Skilled in manipulating these weapons with one hand or two, they eventually learn how to use arcane staves as well, and are just as formidable in combat as their sword-swinging brethren. <br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A staff magus is proficient with simple weapons only. He can cast magus spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus wearing medium armor or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass magus still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. This replaces the normal magus weapon and armor proficiency feature.<br /><br />Quarterstaff Master (Ex): At 1st level, the staff magus gains the Quarterstaff Master feat as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the normal prerequisites. He only gains the benefit of this feat when wearing no armor or light armor.<br /><br />Quarterstaff Defense (Ex): At 7th level, while wielding a quarterstaff, the staff magus gains a shield bonus to his Armor Class equal to the enhancement bonus of the quarterstaff, including any enhancement bonus on that staff from his arcane pool class feature. At 13th level, this bonus increases by +3. This ability replaces the medium armor and heavy armor class abilities.<br /><br />Staff Weapon (Su): At 10th level, a staff magus treats any magical staff he is wielding as a magical quarterstaff with an enhancement bonus to attack and damage equal to the staff&rsquo;s caster level divided by 4 (minimum +1). The staff must have at least 1 charge for the magus to use this ability. A staff magus can restore 1 charge to a staff by expending a number of points from his arcane pool equal to the level of the highest-level spell cast in the staff, as long as at least one spell in the staff is on the magus spell list. The magus cannot restore charges to more than one staff per day.

By physically carving away their tainted flesh, they can use its dark energies to enhance their powers, call forth weapons from thin air, and bypass enemies&rsquo; strongest defenses. A fiend flayer has the following class features.<br /><br />Infernal Mortification (Su): At 1st level, a fiend flayer can sacrifice some of his own infernal blood to add to his arcane pool. Sacrificing blood in this way is a standard action. For every 2 points of Constitution damage the fiend flayer takes in this way, his arcane pool increases by 1 point. Any arcane pool points gained in this way and not spent disappear the next time the magus prepares his spells. Unlike normal ability score damage, this damage cannot be healed by way of lesser restoration. Only time can heal the Constitution damage taken by way of infernal mortification. This ability cannot be used if the fiend flayer&rsquo;s Constitution damage is equal to or greater than 1/2 his Constitution score.<br /><br />Magus Arcana: A fiend flayer gains access to the following magus arcana. He cannot select any arcana more than once. <br /><br />Fiendblade (Su): As a swift action, as long as the fiend flayer used infernal mortification that day to increase his arcane pool, he can conjure forth a weapon using this arcana. Doing so costs 2 points from his arcane pool. The weapon can take the form of any single one-handed melee weapon the fiend flayer is proficient with. This weapon starts as a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus, but for every four levels beyond 3rd the fiend flayer possesses, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 19th level. This summoned weapon lasts for 1 minute. <br /><br />At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties to the fiendblade: anarchic, axiomatic, dancing, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, or unholy. <br /><br />These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool points are spent and cannot be changed until the next time the fiend flayer uses this arcana. Another creature cannot wield the fiendblade; if it leaves the hand of the fiend flayer, it dissipates in a wisp of red smoke that smells of burning blood. <br /><br />A fiend flayer can only have one fiendblade in existence at a time. If he uses this ability again, the first fiendblade disappears. <br /><br />Bypassing Strike (Su): The fiend flayer can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to allow one melee or spellstrike attack he makes before the end of his turn to ignore an evil outsider target&rsquo;s damage reduction.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Magus","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-magenta-3.jpg","_id":"voDTCBm2g9Z0vVpB"}

A kensai is not proficient with armor or shields and suffers normal arcane spell failure chance when casting magus spells while armored.<br /><br />Diminished Spellcasting: A kensai may cast one fewer spell of each level than normal. If this reduces the number to 0, he may cast spells of that level only if his Intelligence allows bonus spells of that level. <br /><br />Canny Defense (Ex): At 1st level, when a kensai is wielding his chosen weapon, he gains the canny defense ability. This is identical to the duelist prestige class ability of the same name (Core Rulebook 382), save that his chosen weapon may be of any type. <br /><br />Weapon Focus (Ex): At 1st level, a kensai gains Weapon Focus with his chosen weapon as a bonus feat.<br /><br />Perfect Strike (Ex): At 4th level, when a kensai hits with his chosen weapon, he can spend 1 point from his arcane pool in order to maximize his weapon damage. Don&rsquo;t roll for damage&mdash;the weapon deals maximum damage. This affects only the weapon&rsquo;s base damage dice, not additional damage from sneak attack, magical weapon properties, spellstrike, or critical hits. <br /><br />If the kensai confirms a critical hit, he can instead spend 2 points from his arcane pool to increase his weapon&rsquo;s critical multiplier by 1. This ability replaces spell recall.<br /><br />Fighter Training (Ex): Starting at 7th level, a kensai counts his magus level &ndash;3 as his fighter level for the purpose of qualifying for feats (if he has levels in fighter, these levels stack), but forfeits the benefit of such feats with weapons other than his favored weapon. This ability replaces knowledge pool.<br /><br />Iaijutsu (Ex): At 7th level, a kensai applies his Intelligence modifier as well as his Dexterity modifier on initiative rolls (minimum 0). A kensai may make attacks of opportunity when flat-footed, and may draw his favored weapon as a free action as part of taking an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces the medium armor ability.<br /><br />Critical Perfection (Ex): At 9th level, a kensai adds his Intelligence bonus (minimum 0) on critical hit confirmation rolls with his favored weapon. In addition, the kensai may use his magus levels in place of his base attack bonuses to qualify for Critical Focus and any feat for which it is a prerequisite; these feats apply only with a kensai&rsquo;s favored weapon. This ability replaces the magus arcana normally gained at 9th level.<br /><br />Superior Reflexes (Ex): At 11th level, kensai can make a number of attacks of opportunity in a round equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). This effect stacks with the Combat Reflexes feat. This ability replaces improved spell recall. <br /><br />Iaijutsu Focus (Ex): At 13th level, a kensai may always act and may draw his weapon as a swift action during a surprise round, though he is considered flat-footed until he acts. During a surprise round or when attacking a flat-footed opponent, he adds his Intelligence modifier on damage with his chosen weapon (minimum 0).

He adds Knowledge (history, local, religion) and all Perform skills to his list of class skills. He does not gain Climb, Ride, and Swim as class skills. This alters the magus&rsquo;s skills.<br /><br />Spells: A puppetmaster can cast spells from the bard and magus spell lists, and treats bard spells as magus spells. Because he does not have a bardic performance ability, some bard spells (which modify or require bardic performance) are poor choices for a puppetmaster. He must add bard spells to his spellbook prior to preparing them as normal. A puppetmaster can learn bard spells from a formula book or spellbook (if they are also alchemist extracts or wizard spells) or a scroll (as if learning a wizard spell from a scroll), or can select them to be one or more of the two magus spells he adds to his spellbook at each magus level. This replaces knowledge pool and greater spell access.<br /><br />Arcane Pool: A puppetmaster cannot expend points from his arcane pool to grant enhancement bonuses or weapon special abilities to a weapon he is holding. As a swift action whenever the puppetmaster casts a spell of the enchantment or illusion school, he can expend 1 point from his arcane pool to increase the spell&rsquo;s save DC or caster level by 1. At 7th level, the increase to the spell&rsquo;s save DC or caster level changes to 2, at 13th level to 3, and at 19th to 4. This alters the magus&rsquo;s arcane pool ability.<br /><br />Puppet Combat (Ex): A puppetmaster can use spell combat, improved spell combat, and greater spell combat only with spells of the enchantment and illusion schools of magic. This ability alters spell combat, improved spell combat, and greater spell combat.<br /><br />Charmstrike (Su): At 2nd level, as a swift action when a foe fails a saving throw against a spell (but not a spelllike or supernatural ability) cast by a puppetmaster, the puppetmaster can expend 1 point from his arcane pool to cast a prepared 1st-level enchantment on the foe. The foe must be one that the spell can target, and is the only creature affected (even if the spell can normally target multiple creatures). At 10th level, the puppetmaster can instead cast a 2nd-level enchantment spell on the foe, and at 16th level, a 3rd-level enchantment spell. The prepared spell is expended, as if cast normally. This ability replaces spellstrike, fighter training, and counterstrike.<br /><br />The Show Must Go On (Su): When a puppetmaster has a creature under the effects of an enchantment spell and that creature has line of sight to an illusion spell the puppetmaster has cast with a duration of concentration, the puppetmaster can link the illusion spell to the enchanted target. As long as the target has line of sight to the illusion and is enchanted, and the puppetmaster has line of sight to both the target and the illusion, the puppetmaster can maintain the illusion as a free action each round. The puppetmaster can maintain only one illusion spell in this way. At 13th level, the puppetmaster can maintain two illusion spells in this way, requiring a separate enchanted target for each illusion. This ability replaces medium armor and heavy armor.<br /><br />Scene Stealer (Su): At 20th level, if a puppetmaster successfully disbelieves an illusion, he can expend 1 point from his arcane pool to try to negate or steal control of the illusion. The puppetmaster attempts a caster level check as if he were dispelling the effect with dispel magic. If he succeeds, he can either end the effect or alter it as if he were the spell&rsquo;s caster. If the spell&rsquo;s duration is concentration, the puppetmaster must concentrate on the new effect (or transfer it to an enchanted target using the show must go on) or it ends.

Rather, eldritch scions find that their spells and abilities come to them instinctively.<br /><br />Spells: An eldritch scion casts arcane spells drawn from the magus spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an eldritch scion must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The DC for a saving throw against an eldritch scion&rsquo;s spell is 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + the eldritch scion&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. An eldritch scion can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as a bard of the same level. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.<br /><br />An eldritch scion&rsquo;s selection of spells is limited. He has the same number of spells known as a bard of the same level, and can choose new spells to replace old ones at 5th level and every 3 class levels after that, just as a bard does. See the bard (Core Rulebook 35) for more information on swapping spells known. This replaces the magus&rsquo;s spells class feature.<br /><br />Bloodline: An eldritch scion gains a bloodrager bloodline. The bloodline is selected at 1st level, and this choice cannot be changed. An eldritch scion&rsquo;s effective bloodrager level for his bloodline abilities is equal to his eldritch scion level. He does not gain any bonus feats, and he gains bonus spells from his bloodline at different levels (see the bonus spell class feature below). To use any ability that normally functions when in a bloodrage, an eldritch scion must spend a point from his eldritch pool (see below).<br /><br />If an eldritch scion takes levels in another class that grant a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, an eldritch scion can change his former bloodline to make them conform.<br /><br />This ability replaces spell recall.<br /><br />Eldritch Pool (Su): An eldritch scion gains an eldritch pool of personal magical energy, equal to 1/2 his magus level (minimum 1) + his Charisma modifier. As a swift action, he can spend a point of eldritch energy to enter a state of mystical focus for 2 rounds. This allows him to use abilities from his bloodrager bloodline as though he were in a bloodrage, though he gains none of the other benefits or drawbacks of bloodraging. At 4th level, an eldritch scion can also use his eldritch pool as an arcane pool, gaining all the benefits listed with the magus&rsquo;s arcane pool class feature.<br /><br />Additionally, any magus&rsquo;s class feature or spell from the magus spell list that normally uses a calculation based on Intelligence is instead based on Charisma for an eldritch scion. For example, an eldritch scion with the arcane accuracy magus arcana grants himself an insight bonus on attacks equal to his Charisma bonus, not his Intelligence bonus. This has no effect on the eldritch scion&rsquo;s skills or skill points. This ability replaces arcane pool, and abilities that modify arcane pool also modify eldritch pool.<br /><br />Spell Combat (Ex): An eldritch scion can only use spell combat while in a state of mystic focus (see eldritch pool, above). At 8th level, an eldritch scion can use spell combat at any time. This ability alters spell combat.<br /><br />Bonus Spells: At 7th level, an eldritch scion gains the bonus spell from his bloodrager bloodline that is normally gained at 10th level. He gains the next three bonus spells from his bloodline at 9th, 11th, and 13th levels, respectively. This ability replaces knowledge pool.<br /><br />Improved Spell Combat (Ex): At 14th level, an eldritch scion gains the improved spell combat class feature. This ability alters improved spell combat.<br /><br />Greater Spell Combat (Ex): At 18th level, an eldritch scion gains the greater spell combat class feature. This ability alters greater spell combat.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Magus","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-magenta-3.jpg","_id":"yByr4l09C9bskQjQ"}

The athame lasts for 1 minute or until dismissed, has an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls equal to the level of the spell sacrificed (maximum +5), and is considered a weapon the spellblade is holding for purposes of his arcane pool feature (using the pool to add abilities to a held weapon applies to the magus&rsquo;s physical weapon and to the athame for no additional cost). The athame acts as a dagger, but the hand holding it is still considered free for the purpose of casting spells and delivering touch attacks. The magus can use the athame as if he were fighting with two weapons, or can use that hand to cast spells as part of the spell combat class ability (but not both in the same round). Attacks with the athame are force attacks and deal force damage. This ability replaces the spellstrike class feature.<br /><br />Spellblade Arcana: A spellblade gains access to the following magus arcana. He cannot select any arcana more than once.<br /><br />Pool-Sourced Athame (Su): Instead of sacrificing a prepared spell to create the force athame, the magus can spend points from his arcane pool to do so. An athame created this way has an enhancement bonus equal to the number of arcane pool points spent.<br /><br />Spellblade Parry (Su): When an enemy makes a melee attack roll against the magus, as an immediate action the magus can end the athame&rsquo;s duration to gain a deflection bonus to his Armor Class until the end of his next turn. This bonus is equal to the level of the spell sacrificed to create the athame (maximum +5).<br /><br />Throw Athame (Su): As a standard action, a spellblade magus can throw his athame up to 60 feet as a ranged attack (no range penalty). If the athame misses, it returns automatically to the magus&rsquo; hand just before his next turn. If the athame hits, it deals damage and its duration ends; the magus can choose to spend up to 2 points from his arcane pool to increase the thrown athame&rsquo;s damage by +1d6 for each point spent.<br /><br />Magus Arcana: The following magus arcana complement the spellblade archetype: critical strike, hasted assault, pool strike, and spell shield.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Magus","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-magenta-3.jpg","_id":"z28zaXIKYOiga1zv"}
