Although the elves of the Mordant Spire originally developed the techniques that spire divers use, people living in coastal areas and archipelagos near the Mwangi Expanse and Tian Xia have similar, independently developed warrior and diving traditions.<br /><br />Studied Target (Ex): A spire diver does not gain the ability to add her studied target bonus on Bluff and Survival checks against an opponent she has studied. At 7th level, she cannot add her studied target bonus on Disguise checks. Instead, when using any bow or crossbow against her studied target underwater, the spire diver ignores the normal penalty for shooting underwater and instead treats the weapon as though its range increment were 10 feet. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the range increment increases by 10 feet, to a maximum of 50 feet.<br /><br />When using a bow or crossbow that already has an underwater range increment, such as an <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/EquipmentWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Underwater%20heavy%20crossbow\">underwater crossbow</a>, the spire diver adds the range increment gained from studied target as a bonus to the weapon&rsquo;s usual underwater range increment, though the combined range increment cannot exceed the weapon&rsquo;s normal range increment.<br /><br />This alters studied target and stalker.<br /><br />Hold Breath (Ex): A spire diver increases the number of rounds she can hold her breath before she is required to start attempting Constitution checks to avoid drowning by 2 per slayer level she has.<br /><br />This replaces track.<br /><br />Slayer Talents: A spire diver can select the <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/RogueTalents.aspx\">strong stroke rogue talent</a> as a slayer talent.<br /><br />Swift Swimmer (Ex): At 11th level, a spire diver gains a swim speed equal to her base speed.<br /><br />This replaces swift tracker.<br /><br />Diver&rsquo;s Advance (Ex): At 13th level, a spire diver can swim up to twice her swim speed once per day as a move action. She can use Stealth as part of this movement but takes a &ndash;10 penalty on her check for doing so. At 17th level, she can use this ability twice per day.<br /><br />This replaces slayer&rsquo;s advance.<br /><br />Diver&rsquo;s Quarry (Ex): A spire diver gains quarry and improved quarry as a normal slayer, but she does not gain the ability to take 10 or take 20 on Survival checks while moving at normal speed without penalty. Instead, at 14th level, a spire diver can take 10 on Knowledge checks to identify a monster she has selected as her quarry.

Once selected, this cannot be changed. When in urban environments, the cutthroat adds 1/2 his slayer level (minimum 1) to checks attempted with this skill. This ability replaces track.<br /><br />Opportune Target (Ex): At 2nd level, a cutthroat who catches a foe by surprise can quickly study that foe to find its weaknesses.

With a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check, he can make ranged attacks with bows while balancing on branches.<br /><br />This replaces track.<br /><br />Ranged Sneak Attack (Ex): At 3rd level, whenever a woodland sniper makes a ranged attack against a creature within 30 feet that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), he deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. This damage increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the woodland sniper score a critical hit with his ranged attack, this additional damage is not multiplied.

Some mortals emulate ankous to become the perfect assassins; others believe themselves to be ankous incarnated in mortal shells on a deep cover mission. In either case, an ankou&rsquo;s shadow practices the deadliest skills of the First World&rsquo;s most feared enforcers.<br /><br />Shadow Double (Sp): An ankou&rsquo;s shadow can take a full-round action to create a single, quasi-real, shadowy duplicate. This shadow double remains in his square, mimicking his movements as a single mirror image, except that it lasts until it is destroyed or he chooses to dismiss it as a swift action. This ability does not stack with the mirror image spell or with similar abilities, such as the copycat ability of the Trickery domain.<br /><br />At 5th level, an ankou&rsquo;s shadow gains a second shadow double. In addition to using these shadow doubles as mirror images in his square, he can move his doubles as part of his own move action, dividing his movement between himself and his doubles. When outside his square, shadow doubles do not protect the ankou&rsquo;s shadow as mirror image and are limited in the actions they can take. Shadow doubles provide flanking for the ankou&rsquo;s shadow and his allies, but they do not possess teamwork feats or special abilities that alter the effects of flanking or aiding another. As a swift action, the ankou&rsquo;s shadow can direct his shadow doubles to use the aid another action, using his own base attack bonus plus his Intelligence modifier for the roll. Although a shadow double appears to duplicate the ankou&rsquo;s shadow&rsquo;s gear, this gear is part of its form; a shadow double&rsquo;s gear cannot be destroyed, dropped, or stolen. A shadow double disappears if it ventures more than 50 feet from the ankou&rsquo;s shadow or if it leaves his line of sight or effect. A shadow double that is hit by an attack roll or takes any damage is destroyed. The AC of a shadow double is equal to the ankou&rsquo;s shadow&rsquo;s touch AC, and it has the same CMD and saving throw bonuses as the ankou&rsquo;s shadow. Shadow doubles possess evasion if the ankou&rsquo;s shadow does. Mind-affecting effects targeting a shadow double affect the ankou&rsquo;s shadow instead, though he isn&rsquo;t affected twice by effects that target both him and a shadow double.<br /><br />At 10th level, an ankou&rsquo;s shadow gains a third shadow double. He can divide his actions between his actual body and his shadow doubles, using them as the origin point for attacks or abilities. For example, an ankou&rsquo;s shadow making three attacks as a part of a full attack could make his primary attack from his own body and his other two attacks from two of his shadow doubles.<br /><br />At 15th level, an ankou&rsquo;s shadow gains a fourth shadow double. In addition to the abilities above, an ankou&rsquo;s shadow can assign the doubles to perform simple tasks on their own, as the unseen servant spell, except that the shadow doubles have an effective Strength score of 10.<br /><br />This ability replaces studied target.<br /><br />Ankou&rsquo;s Vision (Sp): At 7th level, an ankou&rsquo;s shadow can use see invisibility, as per the spell, as a swift action for 1 minute per level per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.<br /><br />This ability replaces stalker.<br /><br />Shadow Prey (Ex): An ankou&rsquo;s shadow cannot denote a target as his quarry unless he has a shadow double present, but unlike other slayers, the target does not need to be one of his studied targets.<br /><br />This ability alters quarry and improved quarry.<br /><br />Unfettered Shadows (Su): At 20th level, as a standard action an ankou&rsquo;s shadow can unfetter all of his shadow doubles for 1 minute. While unfettered, each shadow double can move and attack as if it were the ankou&rsquo;s shadow without using any of his actions. A creature struck by a shadow double can attempt a Will save (DC 20 + the ankou&rsquo;s shadow&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier) each time it takes damage to recognize the illusion. If it succeeds, the target treats all the shadow doubles as 20% real, as the spell shadow conjuration. The shadow doubles cannot use the shadow double ability. The ankou&rsquo;s shadow can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />Slayer Talents: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the ankou&rsquo;s shadow archetype: bleeding attack, fast stealth, slowing strike, and surprise attack.<br /><br />Advanced Slayer Talents: The following advanced slayer talents (and advanced rogue talents) complement the ankou&rsquo;s shadow archetype: assassinate, hunter&rsquo;s surpriseAPG, and woodland stride.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Slayer","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_39.jpg","_id":"9hq156F1eqZNHf20"}

This bonus is reduced by 1 (minimum 0) if the target is not an arcane spellcaster, or a being called or summoned by arcane magic. He does not gain the increases to the maximum number of studied targets he can have at a time normally attained at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, but his bonuses still increase at those levels.<br /><br />This ability alters studied target.<br /><br />Superstitous (Ex): Instead of being able to select ranger combat style feats as slayer talents, a witch killer can select any of the following barbarian rage powers as slayer talents, treating his slayer level as his barbarian level: clear mind, disruptiveAPG, eater of magicUC, spell sunderUC, spellbreakerAPG, sunder enchantmentUC, superstition, or witch hunterAPG. If the witch killer selects a rage power that can normally be used only once per rage (eater of magic, spell sunder, or sunder enchantment), he can use it once per day per 5 slayer levels he possesses, though no more than once per round in any event. The other rage powers affect the slayer constantly, though the superstition and witch hunter rage powers apply only against arcane spells and spell-like abilities and the creatures that use them.<br /><br />Lingering Thrust (Ex): At 4th level, when a witch killer&rsquo;s attack against an arcane spellcaster in the midst of casting forces the spellcaster to attempt a concentration check, the witch killer adds half his slayer level to the check&rsquo;s DC. When he makes a sneak attack against an arcane spellcaster, up to 1 point of sneak attack damage per slayer level counts as ongoing damage for the purpose of forcing the spellcaster to attempt concentration checks (the witch killer does not add half his slayer level to this DC).<br /><br />This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 4th level.<br /><br />Scent Magic (Su): At 5th level, a witch killer can detect arcane magic by scent. He can use detect magic at will (as per a paladin&rsquo;s ability to detect evil), but only against arcane magic, and the ability is scentbased and thus defeated by effects like negate aromaAPG. Even when he isn&rsquo;t concentrating on using his magic scent, when a creature within scent range casts an arcane spell (including arcane spell-like abilities or magic item effects), the witch killer automatically pinpoints the caster&rsquo;s location.<br /><br />Burn the Witch (Sp): At 10th level, once per day when a witch killer observes a creature within 30 feet cast an arcane spell or use an arcane spell-like ability, he can use foster hatredOA on that character, or target one creature harmed by the arcane effect with vengeful outrageUM, identifying the caster as the enemy. He can use this ability twice per day at 15th level, and he can use this ability three times per day at 20th level.

Butterfly blades work in the shadows, eliminating threats with their namesake weapons and intimidating troublesome nobles.<br /><br />Studied Stalker (Ex): A butterfly blade gains the stalker class feature at 1st level, rather than at 7th level. The butterfly blade doesn&rsquo;t add his studied target bonus on Knowledge or Survival checks.<br /><br />This ability alters studied target and replaces track.<br /><br />Bonus Feats: Whenever a butterfly blade would gain a slayer talent, he can instead select a feat from the following list: Cutting HumiliationUI, EnforcerAPG, Intimidating Prowess, Nerve-Racking NegotiatorUI, or Threatening NegotiatorUI. The butterfly blade does not need to meet the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites.<br /><br />This alters slayer talents.<br /><br />Butterfly&rsquo;s Kiss (Ex): Butterfly blades train to inflict painful cuts rather than lethal ones. A butterfly blade can deal nonlethal damage with butterfly swords (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 25) without taking a penalty on attack rolls.

In Numeria, Pureblades are skilled at slaying naturally arising aberrations and any creatures that have been mutated by exposure to the bizarre alien technology that pervades the land. Pureblades from Alkenstar and Nex lead forays into the magic-starved Mana Wastes to eliminate aberrations before the creatures can threaten their lands.<br /><br />Aberration Hunter (Ex): If a Pureblade deals damage to an aberration, as an immediate action he can apply his studied target bonus against that target even if he didn&rsquo;t sneak attack it. In addition, a Pureblade can attempt Knowledge (dungeoneering) skill checks untrained when trying to identify aberrations. This ability replaces track.<br /><br />Alien Prescience (Sp): At 2nd level, as a standard action a Pureblade can detect aberrations. This works like detect undead, except it detects aberrations instead of undead. This ability replaces the slayer talent received at 2nd level.<br /><br />Discern Weakness (Ex): At 7th level, a Pureblade becomes an expert at locating an aberration&rsquo;s weak points. The Pureblade rolls twice to confirm critical hits against aberrations and keeps the higher roll.

This bonus increases to +4 at 12th level and +6 at 16th level. In addition, once per day as a standard action, a Pureblade can shed a magical effect placed on him by an aberration as break enchantment, using his slayer level as his caster level. A Pureblade can use this ability twice per day at 12th level and three times per day at 16th level.

They are adept at fighting tight-knit groups, exploiting their connections to hunt and wound teams. The churches of Iomedae and Milani in particular dispatch special agents to rescue hexed children from Irrisen, Razmiran, and other lands plagued by abusive arcanists and then raise them in this deadly art.<br /><br />Hag Sense (Su): A covenbane&rsquo;s magical scars throb in the presence of magic. A covenbane adds half his level (minimum +1) on Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks to identify, recognize, or track a hag, arcane spellcaster, or creature with spell-like abilities. He can also use his hag sense to recognize whether someone within 30 feet of him is using magic to hide her true form. To do this, he must succeed at a Perception check against a DC equal to 15 + the target&rsquo;s CR; success indicates the presence of a magical disguise, but it does not reveal the creature&rsquo;s true form.<br /><br />This replaces track.<br /><br />Studied Coven (Su): At 2nd level, a covenbane can designate an entire coven as his studied target by studying any single member. He applies his studied target bonus against all members of the studied creature&rsquo;s coven, and all members of the coven count as one target for the purposes of determining the maximum number of studied targets a slayer can maintain. This bonus remains even if one or more members of the coven die after the covenbane studies them. Beginning at 7th level, the covenbane can designate other magically linked creatures, such as those bound by a hivemind or a telepathic bond spell, as a coven, but he can target only three members of such a link.

Some of their ancient techniques persist to this day.<br /><br />Studied Spawn (Ex): A spawn slayer specializes in fighting against larger, single targets. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks against a studied target increase by 1, as do the DCs of slayer abilities against a studied target. He can also ignore size restrictions against a studied target when attempting combat maneuvers against larger foes. At 5th level, if the target is Large or larger, these bonuses increase by an additional 1. At 10th level, if the target is Huge or larger, the bonuses increase by an additional 2. At 15th level, if the target is Gargantuan or larger, the bonuses increase by an additional 3. At 20th level, if the target is Colossal in size, the bonuses increase by an additional 4. A spawn slayer cannot maintain these bonuses against more than one target at a time. He does not gain the ability to study an opponent as a swift action at 7th level.<br /><br />This alters studied target.<br /><br />Gain Leverage (Ex): At 7th level, a spawn slayer learns techniques to counteract a foe&rsquo;s size advantage. When performing a combat maneuver against a studied target of Large or larger size, the spawn slayer gains a bonus on the check equal to the creature&rsquo;s size modifier to CMB (Large +1, Huge +2, Gargantuan +4, and Colossal +8). The spawn slayer adds this same bonus to his CMD when defending against combat maneuvers from a Large or larger studied target.<br /><br />This replaces stalker.<br /><br />Force Vulnerability (Ex): At 20th level, a spawn slayer can create an opening in even an invulnerable foe&rsquo;s defenses. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the damage bypasses any damage reduction and the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + half the slayer&rsquo;s level + the slayer&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier) or lose one of its defensive abilities for 2d6 rounds. The slayer can choose which defensive ability is lost from the following options: a single immunity, all resistances, regeneration, or spell resistance.

He gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat and ignores the usual +20 bonus to the DC of any Perception check to pinpoint the location of an invisible creature. If the spiritslayer manages to pinpoint an invisible creature&rsquo;s location using a Perception check, he can study that creature with his studied target ability as a swift action. <br /><br />In addition, whenever the spiritslayer studies a possessed creature, he can automatically switch his studied target from the possessed creature to the possessing entity should that entity be expelled from his studied target. A spiritslayer adds his studied target bonus on attack rolls to all saving throws he attempts against possession effects used by his studied targets. <br /><br />This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level. <br /><br />Spiritslayer Talents : A spiritslayer can select the following slayer talents, in addition to general slayer talents. <br /><br />Disrupt Possession (Ex): Whenever a spiritslayer with this talent deals sneak attack damage to a creature that is being possessed, he also deals his sneak attack damage to the possessing entity. Once per round, a possessed creature that is damaged by disrupt possession can attempt a new Will saving throw to end the possession, gaining a +1 bonus on its save for each sneak attack damage die the spiritslayer rolled. This talent alters the spiritslayer&rsquo;s sneak attack, and doesn&rsquo;t stack with other talents that alter sneak attack. A spiritslayer must be at least 8th level before selecting this talent. <br /><br />Greater Spirit Sense: A spiritslayer who selects this talent gains Greater Blind-FightAPG as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites. In addition, he adds 1/2 his slayer level to his Perception checks to pinpoint the location of ethereal creatures, and once per round he can attempt a Perception check to pinpoint the locations of all invisible creatures within 30 feet of him without needing to take an action. A spiritslayer must be at least 10th level and have the improved spirit sense spiritslayer talent before selecting this talent. <br /><br />Improved Spirit Sense: A spiritslayer who selects this talent gains Improved Blind-FightAPG as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites. In addition, he adds 1/2 his slayer level on Perception checks to pinpoint the location of an invisible creature. He can use Perception to pinpoint the location of an ethereal creature, but he doesn&rsquo;t gain this bonus on Perception checks when doing so. A spiritslayer must be at least 6th level before selecting this talent. <br /><br />Ghost Slayer (Ex) : At 7th level, whenever a spiritslayer makes an outsider or undead creature with the incorporeal subtype his studied target, his attacks count as magic for the purpose of striking that creature (though this doesn&rsquo;t give his attacks an enhancement bonus) and he can deal precision-based damage to such creatures (though his precision damage is reduced by 50% unless he has a means to bypass the creature&rsquo;s reduction in damage from corporeal sources, such as a ghost touch weapon). At 14th level, the spiritslayer&rsquo;s attacks against outsiders or undead creatures with the incorporeal subtype ignore the 50% reduction in damage from magical corporeal sources that such creatures have and can deal precision-based damage to incorporeal creatures. <br /><br />This ability replaces stalker.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Slayer","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_39.jpg","_id":"fWuMUnhRyTrC7d8L"}

While not all adventurers have the heart for such underhanded dealings, others have developed a knack for it. The turncoat&rsquo;s natural talents for deception and treachery are fitting when negotiating with the untrustworthy inhabitants of Sekamina and other notoriously unscrupulous areas, and his ability to adapt allows him to preempt opponents&rsquo; schemes. Not all party members may be comfortable with having someone so adept at backstabbing among their ranks, but most tend to be grateful that he uses his skills to their benefit.<br /><br />Dubious Recognition (Ex): A turncoat adds half his level (minimum 1) to Sense Motive checks to recognize when a creature is lying or attempting to take advantage of the turncoat and his allies.<br /><br />This replaces track.<br /><br />Double Speak (Ex): At 7th level, a turncoat can attempt a Bluff check in place of a Diplomacy check against a studied target. The target can attempt an opposed Sense Motive check.<br /><br />This ability replaces stalker.<br /><br />Sudden Betrayal (Ex): At 14th level, as a standard action a turncoat can choose a single creature within 30 feet. He gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks against this target.

A bloody jake who becomes nonevil cannot gain new levels as a slayer but retains all his class abilities.<br /><br />Favored Terrain (Ex): At 1st level, a bloody jake can select a type of terrain from the favored terrain table for rangers (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 65), though he is restricted to cold, desert, forest, jungle, mountains, plains, and swamp. His bonuses when in this terrain increase by 2 at 5th level and every 5 slayer levels thereafter, though he does not gain the ability to select additional favored terrains unless he takes the terrain masteryUC rogue talent.<br /><br />This ability replaces the slayer&rsquo;s proficiency in medium armor and shields.<br /><br />Cruel Tricks: Bloody jakes use backwoods folk magic to confuse, terrify, and weaken their prey. A bloody jake can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his slayer level + his Charisma modifier. He gains the cruel tricks below at the indicated slayer levels.<br /><br />Distant Voices (Sp): At 1st level, a bloody jake can cause his voice to seem to emanate from somewhere else, as per ventriloquism. This ability doesn&rsquo;t take any other action to activate and can be used as part of speaking (as a free action); it costs one use of cruel tricks to affect his speech for 1 round.<br /><br />Lose Your Way (Sp): At 4th level, as a standard action, a bloody jake can spend one use of cruel tricks to cause a creature that is within 30 feet and within the bloody jake&rsquo;s favored terrain to become disoriented, taking a penalty on Survival checks equal to the bloody jake&rsquo;s slayer level and a &ndash;2 penalty on saving throws against fear and illusions. This effect lasts for 1 hour per slayer level of the bloody jake or for as long as the affected creature remains within the bloody jake&rsquo;s favored terrain, whichever is shorter.<br /><br />Something&rsquo;s Not Right (Su): At 8th level, as a move action, a bloody jake can spend one use of cruel tricks to cause all foes within 30 feet to become shaken for 1 round. This is a fear effect that doesn&rsquo;t increase in strength by applying other effects that cause creatures to become shaken. At 12th level, he can use this ability as a swift action. At 16th level, a bloody jake can make any number of the affected foes frightened for 1 round, though such foes receive a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the loody jake&rsquo;s slayer level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the frightened condition; even so, such a foe is still shaken.<br /><br />The Woods Have Eyes (Sp): At 12th level, a bloody jake in his favored terrain can spend one use of cruel tricks as a swift action to gain blindsense in a 30-foot radius for 1 round; this blindsense is sound-based.<br /><br />This replaces the 1st-level studied target and the slayer talents gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th level.<br /><br />Poor Study (Ex): A bloody jake gains this ability at 5th level rather than 1st level, beginning with a bonus of +1 at 5th level and increasing by 1 for every 5 slayer levels thereafter. A bloody jake must be 11th level to study an opponent as a move or swift action.<br /><br />This ability alters studied target.<br /><br />Sadistic Snare (Ex): At 6th level, a bloody jake gains Learn Ranger TrapUM as a bonus feat, benefiting from it as if he were a ranger. He can expend two uses of his traps ability to add his sneak attack damage to the trap&rsquo;s damage; any slayer talents or rogue talents he has that modify sneak attack damage, such as bleeding attack, also apply to sneak attack damage dealt by his ranger traps.<br /><br />This replaces the slayer talent gained at 6th level.<br /><br />Cruel Trick (Ex): At 11th level, a bloody jake can maim or humiliate his target with a sneak attack, substituting 1 point of Dexterity or Charisma damage per die of sneak attack damage forfeited. A successful Will save negates this ability damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the bloody jake&rsquo;s slayer level + his Charisma modifier).<br /><br />This ability replaces swift tracker.<br /><br />Woodland Shortcut (Sp): At 13th level, a bloody jake can move with supernatural ease among the trees once per day, as if using tree stride with a caster level equal to his slayer level.<br /><br />This ability replaces slayer&rsquo;s advance.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Slayer","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_39.jpg","_id":"i3WOm523XR4HG6lG"}

He&rsquo;s a merciless killer who can control a sliver of magic, allowing him to arrive unseen, commit murder, and depart without detection.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A stygian slayer is proficient with light armor, but not with medium armor, heavy armor, or any kind of shield (including tower shields). This replaces the slayer&rsquo;s armor proficiency.<br /><br />Invisibility (Sp): At 4th level, a stygian slayer can cast invisibility once per day, using his slayer level as his caster level. The slayer uses his Intelligence modifier for concentration checks when using this ability. The slayer can use this an additional time per day at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 4th level.<br /><br />Spell Use: At 7th level, a stygian slayer is able to use spell completion and spell trigger items as if he were an arcane caster with these spells on his spell list: darkness, forced quietUM, modify memory, nondetection, obscuring mist, phantom steed, shadow walk, and wizard spells of the illusion school of spell level 0 through 4th.

Velvet blades are often born into the aristocracy, with an intricate understanding of the inner workings of upperclass society. Though a few velvet blades are unhinged maniacs who enjoy preying on their peers, most of these well-heeled slayers assume a professional demeanor and hire themselves out to other nobles or well-connected criminal organizations.<br /><br />Class Skills: A velvet blade adds Diplomacy and Knowledge (nobility) to her list of class skills, instead of Knowledge (dungeoneering).<br /><br />This alters the slayer&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Armor Proficiency: A velvet blade is not proficient with medium armor or shields.<br /><br />This alters the slayer&rsquo;s armor proficiency.<br /><br />Studied Socialite (Ex): A velvet blade focuses her studies on social infiltration rather than brute force, believing it is easier to kill an opponent quietly and unprepared than in a loud battle. She adds her studied target bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, Stealth, and Survival checks against studied opponents, as well as to the DCs of slayer class abilities she uses against such opponents.

She gains the BetrayerUC feat as a bonus feat, whether or not she meets the prerequisites. Additionally, when making her first attack against a studied target that believes her to be harmless or to be an ally, the attack counts as a sneak attack, even if the target isn&rsquo;t flanked or denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, and the velvet blade gains +2d6 sneak attack damage, increasing by 1d6 at 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter.

The bounty hunter must declare that he&rsquo;s using this ability before the attack roll is made. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally, but instead of rolling sneak attack damage, the bounty hunter can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against the studied target as a free action, adding 1 to the combat maneuver check for each die of the bounty hunter&rsquo;s sneak attack damage.

Once he has studied an area, the cleaner can attempt a Disguise check to alter evidence or a Stealth check to conceal evidence (by doing things such as cleaning up bloodstains, obscuring footprints, moving a dead body, and so on). Altering an area takes 1d3 \u001d 10 minutes of work per 10-foot square. Anyone attempting to determine what actually happened in that area must succeed at an opposed Perception check against the result of the cleaner&rsquo;s Disguise or Stealth check (cleaner&rsquo;s choice) or accept the altered scene as truth. The cleaner gains a +4 bonus on this check, on Sleight of Hand checks to hide objects from that location on his person, and on Stealth checks to hide within or escape from that location. This lasts as long as the scene remains unaltered (except by the cleaner). This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 4th level.<br /><br />Mislead (Sp): At 7th level, a cleaner can cast misdirection on himself at will. This lasts until the cleaner uses the ability again or ends the effect as a standard action. This ability replaces stalker.<br /><br />Slayer Talents: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the cleaner archetype: camouflageAPG, fast stealth, foil scrutiny*, rogue crawl, surprise attack, and terrain masteryUC. (Those with asterisks [*] are detailed in the slayer class, starting on page 53.)<br /><br />Advanced Slayer Talents: The following advanced slayer talents (and advanced rogue talents) complement the cleaner archetype: assassinate*, knock-out blowAPG, master of disguiseAPG, and slayer camouflage*.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Slayer","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_39.jpg","_id":"rMbES4ADPQTNSOnM"}

Evil deities are more likely to use assassins than deliverers, but some good deities use deliverers to deal with problems of a subtler nature than a cleric, inquisitor, paladin, or warpriest can typically handle.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A deliverer gains proficiency with his deity&rsquo;s favored weapon, in addition to the slayer&rsquo;s normal weapon proficiencies. This ability alters the slayer&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiency.<br /><br />Determined Zeal (Ex): At 2nd level, a deliverer shrugs off attempts by his moral opposite to control or kill him. On any round in which deliverer attacks an opponent whose alignment is at least two steps away from his own (such as a lawful good deliverer fighting a chaotic good or lawful evil foe, or a neutral foe with no other alignment components), he gains a +2 bonus on Will saving throws against that opponent&rsquo;s abilities, as well as the benefit of the Diehard feat until the end of his next turn. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />True Believer (Ex): At 6th level, mortal wounds cannot stop a deliverer from performing his divine duty. On any round in which he attacks an opponent whose alignment is at least two steps away from his own (see Determined Zeal, above) while benefiting from the Diehard feat, he isn&rsquo;t staggered from having negative hit points, nor does he automatically lose 1 hit point per round. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 6th level.<br /><br />Divine Anathema (Ex): At 10th level, as a free action a deliverer can declare a studied target to be his divine anathema. The studied target&rsquo;s alignment must be at least two steps away from that of the deliverer. Against this target, the deliverer&rsquo;s attacks deal an additional 2d6 points of damage; this damage is directly from divine power and does not stack with the bonus damage from a holy or unholy weapon, or a weapon with a similar weapon special ability or effect. A deliverer can have only one divine anathema at a time. This ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained at 10th level.<br /><br />Slayer Talents: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the deliverer archetype: combat trick, finesse rogue, foil scrutiny*, terrain masteryUC, trap spotter, and trapfinding*.

(He does not gain the slayer class abilities that the archetype replaces.)

Quick to react to danger, a vanguard is a valuable scout, capable officer, and skilled tactician.<br /><br />Lookout (Ex): At 1st level, a vanguard adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to initiative checks. This ability replaces track.<br /><br />Tactician (Ex): At 2nd level, a vanguard receives a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. Once per day as a standard action, the vanguard can grant one of his teamwork feats to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every 2 levels the vanguard possesses. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of this bonus feat. Whenever the vanguard is able to select a new slayer talent, he can instead choose to gain an additional use per day of this ability. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Vanguard&rsquo;s Bond (Ex): At 4th level, a vanguard forms a bond with his fighting companions. As a move action, he can choose one of his current studied targets and grant half his studied target bonus against that target to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the slayer&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy or studied target bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 4th level.<br /><br />Ever Ready (Ex): At 7th level, a vanguard is never considered an unaware combatant (Core Rulebook 178) and is always able to act in the surprise round. The vanguard is still flat-footed in the surprise round until he acts. This ability replaces stalker.<br /><br />Slayer Talents: The following slayer talents complement the vanguard archetype: combat trick, finesse rogue, hard to foolAPG, rogue crawl, surprise attack, terrain masteryUC, and weapon training.<br /><br />Advanced Slayer Talents: The following advanced slayer talents (and advanced rogue talents) complement the vanguard archetype: featUC, opportunist, slayer camouflage*, and unwitting allyUC.

As a swift action, he can open a flask of holy water and pour it onto a held or adjacent melee weapon. If the weapon successfully hits an undead creature before the end of the grave warden&rsquo;s next turn, the undead takes damage as if it took a direct hit from the holy water, in addition to the damage from the weapon, if any. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Death Ward (Sp): At 7th level, a grave warden learns to perform a short ritual that grants the benefits of death ward, using his slayer level as his caster level. Performing this ritual takes 1 minute and uses 4 flasks of holy water. The grave warden can protect only himself with this ability. This ability replaces stalker.<br /><br />Dustbringer (Ex): At 10th level, a grave warden can slay a studied undead opponent. This functions as the assassinate slayer talent, except it requires a successful Will saving throw instead of a successful Fortitude save, affects only undead, and destroys the target instead of killing it. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it becomes immune to that grave warden&rsquo;s dustbringer ability for 24 hours.

Streetwise and ruthless, they operate independently, often making their talents available to the highest bidder. Though a few unscrupulous Sczarni executioners exploit this arrangement and force families to pay higher rates for their services, most of these assassins follow a strict personal code and maintain absolute transparency with their employers.<br /><br />Talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to a slayer&rsquo;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.<br /><br />Class Skills: A Sczarni executioner doesn&rsquo;t receive Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Ride (Dex), or Survival (Wis) as class skills. Instead, he receives Appraise (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), and Escape Artist (Dex) in addition to the other standard slayer class skills.<br /><br />Bloodstained Hands (Ex): A Sczarni executioner must be evil. If he ever becomes nonevil, he loses this archetype and becomes a regular slayer.<br /><br />Focused Killer (Ex): At 1st level, a Sczarni executioner&rsquo;s studied target bonuses and the DCs of his slayer abilities increase by 1 against humanoid opponents, but decrease by 1 against non-humanoid targets. This ability alters studied target.<br /><br />Painful Strike* (Ex): At 4th level, a Sczarni executioner automatically gains this talent. Sczarni executioners are trained to cause excruciating pain when striking targets, often leaving them reeling in agony or completely incapacitated as they slowly bleed out. A creature that takes sneak attack damage from a Sczarni executioner must make a successful a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Sczarni executioner&rsquo;s class level + his Intelligence modifier) or become sickened for 1d4 rounds.

He must still succeed at a sneak attack against the target. At 19th level, he can make two such attacks per day.
